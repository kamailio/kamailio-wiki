- if db_insert_mode==2, use async db insert to store the record
- added reason_from_hf module parameter to fill the reason filed from
    header
- added the cdr_expired_dlg_enable module parameter to toggle on/off
    the cdr writing feature (default is off=0)
    - if enabled, only the dlg_vars in the cdr_extra will get printed
        on dialog expiry; the other parameters' values in the cdr extra
        will be left empty

### app_lua

- sr.xavp.get now can return all indexes and can be used with indx \<0
    to return values counting from the end.

    before destroying the embedded interpreter
- new parameter reset_cycles to specify after how many executions the
    embedded interpreter is going to be re-initialized
- synchronized log level values

### async

- new function async_task_route(rname) - execute actions in a routing
    block via core async framework

### auth_db

- new flag for auth_check() to skip caller id check for forwarding
    requests
    - caller id check is skipped for INVITE, BYE, PRACK, UPDATE,
        MESSAGE -- these requests can come with an anonymous caller id
- load_credentials defaults now to empty list (null value)

### carrierroute

- removed dependency on libconfuse

### cdp

- new RPC commands to disable/enable a peer dynamically
- added RPC cmd to list diameter information, including peers and
    their details
- added loadbalancing across diameter peers within the same realm and
    with the same metric

### corex

- corex.shm_status and corex.shm_summary rpc commands
- new function send_data(uri, data)
    - send arbitrary formatted data to uri
    - uri param has to be a valid sip uri
    - both parameters can include pseudo-variables
- functions for management of msg internal flags
    - msg_iflag_set("flagname")
    - msg_iflag_reset("flagname")
    - msg_iflag_is_set("flagname")
    - flagname can be: USE_UAC_FROM, USE_UAC_TO or UAC_AUTH
    - these functions should not be used in configuration file for
        (re)setting the flags, those are done by various functions
        internally, however, in very particular cases they might be
        useful (e.g., changing From/To via textops functions)

### ctl

- fifo server implementation was lacking adding struct values-
    specifier '{' was not handled for adding values
- implemented adding array with '\[' specifier

### db_cluster

- new parameter max_query_length - set threshold in second after which
    a connection is marked inactive if the query fails
- allow to let connectioncs being active if the error is due to some
    sql mistake - default is 0 (set connection inactive immediately,
    same behavior as so far)

### db_mysql

- implemented async raw query and async insert - both use the core
    async framework

### db_text

- refactoring to store result in private container, instead of
    connection structure

### debugger

- show route name in cfgtrace output
- new parameter log_level_name - allow overwriting default log level
    name for cfgtrace messages

### dialog

- added parameter and dialog property to disable timeout reset
- option to run dialog main timer tasks via dedicated process
    - timer_procs - new parameter, if set to 1, a dedicated timer
        process is used, if set to 0 (default), the core timer is used
        (existing behavior)
- if ACK for 200ok is not coming in 60sec, dialog lifetime is
    shortened for 10 more seconds
- refactored json serialization format for dialog profiles
- add a unique id for each profile item - internal sruid is used for
    generating uids
- internal refactoring to allow adding remote profile - this is a
    profile item without a local dialog - allow operations to add or
    remove such profiles
- added cleanup of expired remote profiles via internal timer
- new config function - dlg_remote_profile - dlg_remote_profile(cmd,
    profile, value, uid, expires
    - manage non-local profiles from configuration file
    - cmd can be add (insert a remote profile) and rm (remove a remote
        profile)
- allow '\_' in dlg profile names
- replicate profiles to other nodes via dmq module
- add option to increment cseq upon local authentication to next hop
    - feature has to be enabled via module parameter
        track_cseq_updates
    - it does it only for downstream direction (requests from caller
        and callee, as it is the typical use case of calling via a
        provider, after authenticating the caller locally, provider asks
        for another 'trunk' authentication
    - diff of cseq value is stored in dialog var named 'cseq_diff',
        therefore be sure it is not overwritten from config

### dialog_ng

- added DB support for dialog_ng

### dispatcher

- expand attrs while running rpc command dispatcher.list
- ds_select_dst/domain can take args as string (not only int) -
    internal conversion of string->int (if possible)
- new variant - ds_is_from_list(groupid, mode, uri)
    - can match against records in dispatcher groups
    - if groupid==1 - will match against all groups
    - if uri is empty, then will match against source address (ip,
        port, proto). Otherwise it has to be a full SIP URI value. The
        matching is not taking in consideration any parameter apart of
        transport
        - mode is a bitmask to tell the matching rules
            - if it is 0, will match everything: ip, port and protocol
            - if bit one is set, will skip matching the port
            - if bit two is set, will skip matching the protocol

### dmq

- added function to broadcast message from config file
- added RPC interface to query the nodes in the cluster
- new function: dmq_t\_replicate() - replicates current SIP message to
    all active DMQ nodes. Includes built-in loop detection which can be
    skipped with optional parameter
- new function: dmq_is_from_node() - Checks whether current message
    has come from another node, based on source IP

### htable

- add event route when htable entries expire
    - event_route\[htable:expired:\<table>\] called when an entry
        expires
    - pseudo-vars $shtrecord(key) and $shtrecord(value) access the
        expired content
- new config function sht_reset("tname") - remove all items in the
    hash table
- iterator implementation for hash tables
    - new functions:
        - sht_iterator_start(iname, hname)
        - sht_iterator_next(iname)
        - sht_iterator_end(iname)
    - the current item in the iterator is accessible via:
        - $shtitkey(iname)
        - $shtitval(iname)

- option to disable the "received check" upon lookup
- new module parameter ignore_contact_rxport_check to ignore check on

    P-CSCF to check(and possibly) change the transport for the request
    before relaying/fwding to terminating UE
- option to ignore "REGISTERED STATE", when checking for a registered
    client

### ims_registrar_scscf

        limit are not changed)
- added hash_size parameter
    - can be used to set the number of slots for the internal hash
        table, which is computed as 2^hash_size (aka 1\<\<hash_size)

        tracing to more than one server.
- added force_send_sock parameter - the local interface in form of SIP
    uri from where to send the duplicated traffic

### sqlops

- new cfg function - sql_query_asycn(con, sql)
    - execute sql statement via async raw query, if implemented by db
        driver module (e.g., db_mysql
    - the query is executed in another process and result is not

### tmx

- t_cancel_callid() can set the Reason header in generated CANCEL
- new function t_reuse_branch()
- new variable: $T_branch(flags)

    early phase, to avoid simultaneous processing until transaction is
    created

    check - enable/disable usage of t_precheck_trans() - don't init
    internal structures

### topoh

    mi/rpc commands
- option to set datetime columns as bigint
    - should handle better daylight shifting

        last modified columns to be bigint
    - the change to the type of columns has to be done manually to the
        database server
    - default values is 0, expecting to work with datetime columns
        (existing behavior)
- new parameter db_raw_fetch_type - specify what type of query should
    be used in DB-only mode for retrieving contacts for specific needs
    (e.g., sending NAT keepalives)
- option to control if the null fields should be in insert statement

### utils

- http_query() now stores result also in case of 4xx replies
