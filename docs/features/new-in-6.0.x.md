## New In Existing Modules

### cfgutils

- **lock** family functions got another optional key parameter to
  generate the hash id. See [#3808](https://github.com/kamailio/kamailio/pull/3808)
  or [cfgutils docs](https://www.kamailio.org/docs/modules/devel/modules/cfgutils.html)
  for details

### permissions

- **allow_register_include_port()**, the permissions module got a new function, which extends
  a functionality for checking contacts (locations) allowed to be registered.
  With a newer function one has a possibility to include Contact URI port into this check.
  See [#3846](https://github.com/kamailio/kamailio/pull/3846)
  or [permissions docs](https://www.kamailio.org/docs/modules/devel/modules/permissions.html)
  for details.

### pua_dialoginfo

- **use_uuid** optional parameter to generate pres_id using libuuid via uuid module

### rabbitmq

- kamailio init will not fail if rabbitmq connection doesn't work. The module will try to reconnect
  when **rabbitmq_publish()** or **rabbitmq_publish_consume()** are called in the config.

### sca

- **from_uri_avp** **to_uri_avp** module parameters adding the possibility of define what is the URI value
  for To and/or From instead of the values coming from the SIP message.

### siputils

- **sip_p_charging_vector()** Once a new PCV has been generated by 'g' or 'f' the PCV cannot be changed
  again.
  The icid-generated-at parameter of a generated PCV will now be set to the sending interface IP address
  The function now returns a status value about what was done.

- **$pcv(status)** New pseudo-variable parameter. Returns whether the PCV header was successfully parsed,
  deleted, newly generated or other.
  See [#3929](https://github.com/kamailio/kamailio/pull/3846)
  or [siputils](https://www.kamailio.org/docs/modules/devel/modules/siputils.html)
  for details.
