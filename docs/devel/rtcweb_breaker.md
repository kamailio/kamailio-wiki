The [Doubango Telecom](http://www.doubango.org)
[webrtc2sip](http://webrtc2sip.org/) gateway includes an RTCWeb Breaker
component. The Doubango RTCWeb Breaker is a B2BUA. It would be useful to
have a Kamailio RTCWeb Breaker that is lighter-weight and which can be
used without degrading the SIP signalling by using a B2BUA.

An RTCWeb Breaker converts SDP and media streams between those supported
by WebRTC end-points and non-WebRTC end-points. An RTCWeb Breaker does
not need to transcode the media streams; G.711 is supported by most SIP
UAs and is a Mandatory To Implement (MTI) codec in WebRTC, and many SIP
UAs now support OPUS and VP8 too.

## Proposed RTCWeb Breaker architecture

The RTCWeb Breaker should consist of two components:

- A Kamailio control module
- An RTCWeb Breaker daemon

Kamailio should control the RTCWeb Breaker using a light-weight TCP
protocol. SDP should be handled and manipulated by the RTCWeb daemon.

RTCWeb Breaker sessions should be initiated within Kamailio failure
routes and branch-failure routes. In parallel forking scenarios Kamailio
should create distinct RTCWeb Breaker sessions in branch-failure routes
enabling sessions to be successfully forked to WebRTC and non-WebRTC
end-points.

## Scenarios

The RTCWeb Breaker SHOULD support:

- Sessions from WebRTC to non-WebRTC end-points
- Sessions from non-WebRTC to WebRTC end-points
- Session renegotiation using re-INVITE and UPDATE
- Early media (SDP in 183, PRACK, and UPDATE)
- SDP offer in INVITE and answer in 180/183/200
- SDP offer in 180/183/200 and answer in ACK
- Parallel forking (distinct RTCWeb Breaker sessions for each branch
    that requires it)
