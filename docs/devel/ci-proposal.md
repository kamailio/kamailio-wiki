### Continuous Integration on Kamailio Project

#### Automated Debian/Ubuntu package building

The build system for Debian and Ubuntu packages service is kindly
sponsored by [Sipwise](http://www.sipwise.com). Sipwise is providing the
hosting and man power to create and manage this system.

[deb.kamailio.org](http://deb.kamailio.org) is based on
[jenkins-debian-glue](https://github.com/mika/jenkins-debian-glue)
project running on AWS EC2 environment thanks to [Michael
Prokop](http://michael-prokop.at/) and myself. All the needed files,
scripts and info to reproduce this system is kept public at
[github](https://github.com/sipwise/kamailio-deb-jenkins).
