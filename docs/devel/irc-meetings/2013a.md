## Agenda

Kamailio related:

- (dcm) outstanding issues at this time, if any
- (dcm) roadmap to next major release
- (dcm) timeline for a new minor release
- (dcm) moving compile time options to module to be able to load them
    at runtime
  - sctp module
  - what else?
- (dcm) failure route handles on local delivery errors
  - execute failure routes when tcp connection is not open
- (dcm) dialog vs dialog_ng
- (dcm) source code tree restructuring
- (pd) Outbound/GRUU - is any more development needed (in-dialog
    failures and single-server) (see
    [completing_outbound](../completing_outbound.md))
- (pd) MSRP (see [completing_msrp](../completing_msrp.md))
- (pd) RTCWeb Breaker (see [rtcweb_breaker](../rtcweb_breaker.md))
- (pd) Presence - does anyone have the time/interest to move this
    forward at the moment (see
    [completing_presence](../completing_presence.md))
- (pd) Any interest in [Amazon
    DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) support?
  - Amazon proprietary NoSQL database
  - .NET, Java, and PHP SDKs available
  - A bit like a managed Cassandra installation (so in theory can be
        used for domain, location, and subscriber tables)
- (pd) event_route for TCP connection close
- (osas) xhttp module
  - improve the API by providing a response buffer to build in http
        replies
  - improve the API to allow sending an HTTP reply in chunks
  - integrate xhttp with xmlrpc
- (hpw) Suggested feature - debug level per module
  - E.g. 'debug presence 3'
  - Would allow debugging modules without spamming from other
        modules (e.g. database)

## Transcripts

To be added.
