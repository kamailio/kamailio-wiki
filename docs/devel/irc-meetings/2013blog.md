# Chat log IRC Devel Meeting - 2013-09-12

## outstanding issues at this time, if any

\[16:00 - \[16:06\] are missing from my chat client, sorry
\[16:06\] \<miconda> the last one was sent to sr-dev, iirc
\[16:06\] \<miconda> the minutes
\[16:07\] \<miconda> oej: yes, it seems for the last one are only on
sr-dev (at least not on wiki)
\[16:07\] \<miconda> Vicente was sending them
\[16:08\] \<miconda> ok … no outstanding issues for now
\[16:08\] \<miconda> next topic

## roadmap to next major release

\[16:08\] \<miconda> let's do planning for next minor release
\[16:08\] \<miconda> and do major release at the end
\[16:09\] \<miconda> after we see the near future plans for
development.
\[16:09\] \<ZogG_laptop> hello
\[16:09\] \<miconda> last minor release was in August 15
\[16:09\] \<miconda> perhaps we can do one by end of September or so
(before Astricon)
\[16:10\] \<henningw> sounds good
\[16:10\] \<miconda> I haven't looked at patches since 4.0.3, but I
remember I did a few of them
\[16:11\] \<linuxmaniac> one crash is fixed on ua_redirect
\[16:11\] \<miconda> linuxmaniac: ok, thanks for it
\[16:11\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: my pleasure :-)
\[16:12\] \<ZogG_laptop> oh not shure if patch was sent but there is
small bug in presence module
\[16:12\] \<ZogG_laptop> at least it's still at 4.0.3
\[16:12\] \<miconda> ok then -- 4.0.4 by end of September
\[16:12\] \<linuxmaniac> \\o/
\[16:12\] \<miconda> ZogG_laptop: send it over sr-dev
\[16:12\] \<miconda> or put it on the tracker
\[16:12\] \<miconda> if already fixed, will be marked as done
\[16:13\] \<miconda> what people prefer to do now -- the techical
(devel) topics or the admin ones?
\[16:14\] \<linuxmaniac> tech?
\[16:14\] \<miconda> ok
\[16:14\] \<miconda> first come first served
\[16:14\] \<miconda> technical topics

## xcap-diff - purpose and testing

\[16:14\] \<miconda> one I wanted to get some input is about xcap-diff
\[16:15\] \<miconda> as I said during last irc meeting I will try to do
it before next major release
\[16:15\] \<ZogG_laptop> miconda: not sure if it would be right one. the
problem that docs states that reginfo_handle_notify() doesn't get any
parameters while in code it does want one
\[16:15\] \<ZogG_laptop> so just changing 1 to zero fixed the error from
script
\[16:15\] \<miconda> ZogG_laptop: maybe is not the right fix, if it
expects some parameter
\[16:16\] \<miconda> but report it and we look at
\[16:16\] \<ZogG_laptop> ok thanks
\[16:16\] \<ZogG_laptop> i'll do
\[16:16\] \<miconda> carstenbock is the developer, iirc
\[16:16\] \<carstenbock> That's right, i implemented it.
\[16:16\] \<miconda> and I saw some reports on tracker this morning
\[16:16\] \<carstenbock> Haven't looked at the recent bug-reports,
though.
\[16:17\] \<miconda> that ruid is not set for records
\[16:17\] \<carstenbock> Putting the bug on the tracker is the best
way.
\[16:17\] \<miconda> some are already there (regarding reginfo)
\[16:17\] \<miconda> ok, back to my xcap-diff, maybe pdunkley can
comment
\[16:18\] \<pdunkley> Definitely in favour of getting xcap-diff
support.
\[16:18\] \<miconda> from quick check of the specs, looks like the body
for notifies has to be pretty much the xml chunk that was uploaded with
put
\[16:18\] \<miconda> is it right?
\[16:19\] \<pdunkley> Sort-of.
\[16:19\] \<miconda> I started to add, pua and presence should be able
to handle them
\[16:19\] \<miconda> the missing part is the publish from xcap-server
\[16:19\] \<pdunkley> Problem is that NOTIFYs must be throttled, for
example no-more than one per five second period per dialog.
\[16:19\] \<pdunkley> So what do you do if there are two changes to the
document in that period?
\[16:19\] \<miconda> pdunkley: everything is sort-of in SIMPLE :-)
\[16:19\] \<miconda> throttling is required by specs?
\[16:20\] \<pdunkley> And of course, you can only have one NOTIFY
outstanding at a time, so you can't send the second until you have a
final response to the first.
\[16:20\] \<miconda> can we just say at some point, hey, just take the
full docs
\[16:20\] \<pdunkley> The base SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY spec. mandates
throttling and recommends 5s for presence.
\[16:21\] \<pdunkley> It's up to each specification that defines an
event-package to say what the throttle rate should be, but the spec.
does have to say it.
\[16:21\] \<pdunkley> If the xcap-diff spec. doesn't I'd think it needs
to be the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY default of 5s.
\[16:21\] \<pdunkley> I think you can basically say "the doc has changed
and it is too complicated for a patch - so just get it again".
\[16:22\] \<pdunkley> That'd be a good starting point for the first
version.
\[16:22\] \<pdunkley> The presence module already has NOTIFY throttling
in it, so if you do say "get the whole doc" all of the time it should
just work (I think).
\[16:22\] \<miconda> ok, so we can go with kind of workaround, if we
have many changes within the throttling interval, then just mark it for
complete refresh?!?
\[16:23\] \<miconda> keeping the list of diffs can get complex
otherwise
\[16:24\] \<pdunkley> I agree.
\[16:24\] \<miconda> ok, for now I am fine with this topuc
\[16:24\] \<pdunkley> This is the server side of xcap-diff?
\[16:24\] \<miconda> yes
\[16:24\] \<pdunkley> So it allows presence servers and UAs to SUBSCRIBE
to the XCAP server?
\[16:25\] \<pdunkley> Is there any need or desire to do the client side
of xcap-diff at some point?
\[16:25\] \<miconda> yes, do you want a client?
\[16:25\] \<miconda> maybe for those implementing sip clients...
\[16:25\] \<pdunkley> This would mean the presence module and rls
modules could subscribe to the XCAP server (including a non-Kamailio
XCAP server) instead of the proprietary
internal links.
\[16:26\] \<pdunkley> There is already the XCAP client module in
Kamailio that can be used when presence/rls and xcap-server don't share
a DB.
\[16:26\] \<miconda> for now my focus is on server
\[16:26\] \<pdunkley> OK, just checking.
\[16:27\] \<pdunkley> Does anyone know of a good (and free) client that
supports xcap-diff?
\[16:27\] \<miconda> xcap client is just xcap -- no sip/presence in it,
which will be required here
\[16:27\] \<miconda> so I assume it would have to be a pua_XXX module
\[16:27\] \<pdunkley> The only one I know of is Blink. But not sure how
good the other bits of Blink presence are...
\[16:28\] \<miconda> pdunkley: probably not, but I though you will add
it to your communicator :-)
\[16:28\] \<pdunkley> Lol
\[16:28\] \<jh> i have tested sipclients presence and found bugs in it
that have not been fixed
\[16:28\] \<pdunkley> We are quite happily using XMPP in a CUSAX like
way at the moment.
\[16:28\] \<miconda> i am not aware of a good ones, free or not
\[16:28\] \<miconda> pdunkley: ok
\[16:29\] \<pdunkley> May do SIP presence and XCAP in the future, if
there is demand for it.
\[16:29\] \<miconda> ok, then let's mark this topic done
\[16:29\] \<miconda> next one: dialog vs dialog_ng

## dialog vs. dialog_ng

\[16:29\] \<miconda> I don't see Jason here for getting more details
about dialog ng
\[16:30\] \<miconda> anyone else here using it? (carstenbock)
\[16:30\] \<carstenbock> I am a heavy user.
\[16:31\] \<oej> so what are the differences?
\[16:31\] \<carstenbock> There are some differences between dialog and
dialog_ng. A big part is actually, that you can tear down calls even
during setup-phase.
\[16:31\] \<oej> What's the plan
\[16:31\] \<ZogG_laptop> tear?
\[16:31\] \<carstenbock> terminated
\[16:31\] \<ZogG_laptop> oh
\[16:31\] \<oej> hang up
\[16:32\] \<carstenbock> e.g. if the network fails during call-setup
(detected via Diameter-Rx), you can terminate a call if it is not
connected yet.
\[16:33\] \<miconda> but there were some parts missing from the old
dialog, or all features of the old dialog are in dialog_ng?
\[16:33\] \<carstenbock> That's about the main difference. I think
another difference is, that the API has a direct function for
terminating calls.
\[16:33\] \<carstenbock> What is missing (as with most IMS-modules
actually), is the database-backend.
\[16:34\] \<carstenbock> All information is only in memory at the
moment.
\[16:34\] \<oej> are all the rpc commands there?
\[16:35\] \<miconda> carstenbock: that's fine, kamailio just keeps
running
\[16:35\] \<miconda> :-)
\[16:35\] \<carstenbock> Exactly that's the case... ;-)
\[16:35\] \<oej> Who needs to depend on databases then?
\[16:35\] \<oej> A new definition of "no-sql"
\[16:35\] \<carstenbock> Jason also mentioned, that they implemented a
lot of the stuff that's was in a wiki page about improvements in the
dialog module.
\[16:36\] \<carstenbock> I don't know, what they all implemented from
this page:
http:*<www.kamailio.org/dokuwiki/doku.php/modules-new-design:dialog-module-design>
\[16:37\] \<miconda> ok, db backend is important -- I will try to catch
up with Jason on mailing lists
\[16:38\] \<miconda> I had in mind to do some cleanup on the matching
modes of the old dialog
\[16:38\] \<miconda> probably I will still do it
\[16:39\] \<ZogG_laptop> i see there is option to get dialog by cutom
added key (from module doc  get_dlg_var (dlg, key) )
\[16:39\] \<carstenbock> Regarding matching modes: dialog_ng does only
matching on SIP-Elements, nothing else.
\[16:39\] \<carstenbock> I don't think we have that in dialog_ng
(yet).
\[16:40\] \<miconda> carstenbock: yes, that was my plan as well, plus
few optimizations for faster matching
\[16:40\] \<miconda> I'll see if I have enough time
\[16:40\] \<miconda> anything else on the technical side?
\[16:41\] \<miconda> I assume the code restructuring will be postponed,
doesn;t look like enough time for it
\[16:41\] \<carstenbock> I can confirm, dialog_ng works excellent (for
me in my setups)
\[16:41\] \<miconda> carstenbock: all our homeworks worked at home :-)
\[16:41\] \<miconda> I don't disagree with you, actually
\[16:42\] \<kolbu> in the old dialog module we still see a stuck dialog
if a 486 and 200 is received at more or less exactly the same time
\[16:42\] \<miconda> just that many features might be missing
\[16:42\] \<ZogG_laptop> so regards that function, does it as well
support dialog properties?
\[16:42\] \<miconda> kolbu: with latest 4.0 branch?
\[16:42\] \<kolbu> running 4.0.3 ++
\[16:42\] \<kolbu> that is, a few days after 4.0.3
\[16:43\] \<miconda> kolbu: what state it hangs on?
\[16:43\] \<kolbu> 4
\[16:43\] \<ZogG_laptop> e.g. from_tag/caller_contact/etc or it does
support only custom added ones from set_dlg_var ?
\[16:43\] \<iZverg> are read dialogs from db in dialog-ng ?
\[16:43\] \<kolbu> which is good, because then we can close it with the
dlg_end_dlg fifo
\[16:43\] \<iZverg> are read dialogs from db in dialog-ng \_planned\_?
\[16:43\] \<ZogG_laptop> iZverg: afaik no db implantation was made for
dialog_ng
\[16:44\] \<carstenbock> Not yet. That will follow.
\[16:44\] \<miconda> kolbu: maybe you can open a tracker item and add
some details there
\[16:44\] \<carstenbock> DB-Support is definitely planned, but not
scheduled yet...
\[16:45\] \<iZverg> i think in dialog need ability to read dialogs from
db
===== memcached module ===== \[16:46\] \<iZverg> and memcached multiple
servers. as i see no developer for memcached now?
\[16:46\] \<kolbu> miconda: ok, will do
\[16:46\] \* dr wants the memcached module that compiles with
libmemcached in kamailio 4.0.4 :)
\[16:46\] \<miconda> iZverg: memcached module was refactored rather
recently
\[16:46\] \<kolbu> worth mentioning that the dialog module in 4.0 is
sooo much more reliable than in 3.3
\[16:46\] \<miconda> so there are developers for it
\[16:47\] \<miconda> kolbu: ok
\[16:47\] \<miconda> dr: I think devel version compiles with that lib
\[16:47\] \<miconda> perhaps henningw or cchance can confirm that
\[16:47\] \<dr> yes miconda, we've been testing it , it works
\[16:47\] \<miconda> ok
\[16:47\] \<iZverg> yes, it compiled but only one server supported
\[16:48\] \<henningw> the library has support for more server, i think
\[16:49\] \<henningw> should be not to hard to extend, patches are as
always welcome :)
\[16:49\] \<henningw> the devel version uses the new library
\[16:49\] \<henningw> s/new/good library
\[16:49\] \<miconda> ok
\[16:49\] \<miconda> anything else on technical aspects?
\[16:50\] \<miconda> other modules to add/fix/remove?
===== presence_dialoginfo module ===== \[16:50\] \<ZogG_laptop> the
presence one
\[16:50\] \<miconda> ZogG_laptop: what you mentioned already, right?
\[16:50\] \<ZogG_laptop> nope
\[16:51\] \<ZogG_laptop> improvemnet
\[16:51\] \<ZogG_laptop> there is force_single mode or something like
that
\[16:51\] \<ZogG_laptop> which would send only 1 state in xml
\[16:51\] \<ZogG_laptop> early/confirmed/etc
\[16:51\] \<ZogG_laptop> it would pick up mostly randomly
\[16:52\] \<miconda> you refer to presence_dialoginfo module?
\[16:52\] \<admorten> I've got a bunch of updates to the sca module to
pull into 4.x and master.
\[16:52\] \<ZogG_laptop> leme check
\[16:53\] \<ZogG_laptop> miconda: yes
\[16:53\] \<miconda> admorten: ok, you should do it soon so they get
tested
\[16:53\] \<miconda> ZogG_laptop: ok
\[16:53\] \<admorten> Will do.
\[16:53\] \<ZogG_laptop> miconda: the priority should be
early->confirmed->terminated
\[16:53\] \<miconda> ZogG_laptop: again, perhaps opening an item on
tracker will help not forgetting and checking it
\[16:54\] \<dr> having working dialog profiles would be nice
\[16:54\] \<ZogG_laptop> miconda: ok. i even may try to get patch for
this one
\[16:54\] \<miconda> ZogG_laptop: that is even better, thanks
\[16:54\] \<ZogG_laptop> miconda: it would be better though if it would
be checked before applied
\[16:54\] \<miconda> dr: they seem fine, you have troubles with?
\[16:55\] \<admorten> Re: our own sca module deployment. We now have
8345 SCA subscribers, and I've been hearing from a number of other
places that they're rolling it out.
\[16:55\] \<miconda> ZogG_laptop: sure, they will be reviewed
\[16:55\] \<miconda> admorten: nice, thanks for sharing the numbers
\[16:55\] \<miconda> admorten: is a single sca server?
\[16:56\] \<admorten> Yes, at the moment.
\[16:56\] \<dr> # set_dlg_profile("caller", "count");
\[16:56\] \<dr> ##
get_profile_size("caller","count","$avp(callcount)");
\[16:56\] \<dr> ## xlog("L_INFO","number of simultaneous dialogs:
$avp(callcount)\\n");
\[16:56\] \<miconda> not bad then, for handling lots of xml docs
\[16:56\] \<dr> i want it to decrement automatically
\[16:56\] \<admorten> Right. We have a replicated environment for
failover.
\[16:56\] \<dr> it doesn't , it always increments that counter
\[16:56\] \<admorten> miconda: SCA doesn't use XML. :)
\[16:56\] \<miconda> admorten: ok, that;s different
\[16:57\] \<miconda> but you said at some point that does dialog-info as
well
\[16:57\] \<miconda> or I misunderstood?
\[16:57\] \<miconda> or you don't use that part...
\[16:57\] \<admorten> That'd be BLA, which we struggled with.
\[16:57\] \<kethzer> Need to know how to enable kamailio to send file
over a NATED network
\[16:57\] \<kethzer> any hel
\[16:57\] \<kethzer> help???/
\[16:57\] \<admorten> XML bodies would grow massive, then packet
fragmentation would overwhelm the handsets.
\[16:58\] \<admorten> Inconsistent state across the groups.
\[16:58\] \<miconda> dr: it will be decremented when the dialog is
ended/destroyed
\[16:58\] \<miconda> kethzer: you have to wait a bit for support
questions, we are doing development and admin meeting
\[16:58\] \<dr> miconda, that's what I thought too, but this does not
happen with my script
\[16:59\] \<dr> i had to put the counter in memcache , and increment /
decrement manually
\[16:59\] \<miconda> I do use it in many places, no problem so far...
\[16:59\] \<miconda> what version are you using?
\[16:59\] \<dr> 4.0.2
\[17:00\] \<miconda> you should shift to latest in 4.0 branch, there
were some fixes for negative replies
\[17:00\] \<miconda> or do dialog related things just before t_relay()
\[17:01\] \<ZogG_laptop> dr:are you trying to get total dialogs per
subscriber?
\[17:01\] \<dr> and http_query() from the utils module , it might need
some heavy improvements, it returns only the first line from the
buffer
\[17:01\] \<oej> It is documented to only do that :-)
\[17:01\] \<dr> ZogG_laptop, no , total number of dialogs
===== http modules ===== \[17:02\] \<oej> But yes, we need improvements
in http_client
\[17:02\] \<oej> Sorry, I would say we need a http_client module that
consolidates all http clients
\[17:02\] \<oej> We have several different ones
\[17:02\] \<miconda> dr: speaking of that, I think carstenbock did some
work on http client lately
\[17:03\] \<miconda> but iirc, he pushed on a personal branch
\[17:03\] \<oej> There's one in utils, one in jsonrpc and one in xcap
client and possibly sip identy
\[17:03\] \<oej> From the top of my head. Some use libcurl.
\[17:03\] \<miconda> oej: right, maybe we should pull out http client
part from all modules and have one that will be reused
\[17:04\] \<oej> I think that would be a good thing moving forward.
\[17:04\] \<miconda> jsonrpc client uses netstrings, iirc
\[17:04\] \<miconda> is not over http
\[17:04\] \<oej> Then we could get IPv6 in every one and solve happy
eyeballs once.
\[17:04\] \<dr> miconda, thx . one more thing: i don't think the dialog
module works very good with event_route\[tm:local-request\] either .
$DLG_TIMEOUT is not getting set
\[17:05\] \<miconda> dr: has to be checked, not using it like that so I
cannot comment now -- open an issue on tracker to have it in mind
\[17:05\] \<miconda> carstenbock: any comments on your recent work on
http cleint?
\[17:05\] \<dr> $DLG_lifetime, sorry
\[17:06\] \<miconda> ok, let's move forward (probably carstenbock has
left a bit)
\[17:06\] \<miconda> anything else on tech stuff?
\[17:06\] \<jh> how about mediaproxy-ng module?
\[17:07\] \<admorten> Question about core support for maximum branches.
We're currently limited by a 32-bit mask to 30 branches. I have some
early work moving to 64-bit mask for branch tracking. Anyone else
interested?
===== rtpproxy_ng ===== \[17:07\] \<miconda> jh: rtpproxy_ng?
\[17:07\] \<miconda> admorten: yes, could be interesting
\[17:07\] \<ZogG_laptop> miconda:
https:*github.com/sipwise/mediaproxy-ng
\[17:08\] \<miconda> push the patches somewhere for some review
\[17:08\] \<jh> yes, ment rtpproxy-ng (naming is confusing)
\[17:08\] \<admorten> miconda: OK
\[17:08\] \<miconda> jh: yes, I know, quite confusing in both sides,
even the external application
\[17:08\] \<admorten> I'll put them up on sip-router tracker and post to
sr-dev when ready.
\[17:08\] \<jh> there was some bugs found. will those be fixed before
next release?
\[17:09\] \<miconda> probably yes. I don't see Richard here
\[17:09\] \<miconda> but I guess sipwise is highly interested to get all
bugs closed
\[17:09\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: :yes:
\[17:09\] \<miconda> linuxmaniac may be able to comment more
\[17:09\] \<miconda> I know some were fixed already
\[17:10\] \<miconda> hughw: send some patches as well, e
\[17:10\] \<miconda> were they done?
\[17:10\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: afaik yes

## http modules

\[17:10\] \<carstenbock> (sorry for the delay: i just added support for
POST-requests to the http_query() function. Needs a little bit testing,
but should be okay)
\[17:10\] \<miconda> rephrasing: hughw sent some patches to
rtpproxy-ng
\[17:10\] \<linuxmaniac> I think they are been merged
\[17:10\] \<miconda> linuxmaniac: ok
\[17:11\] \<miconda> carstenbock: ok, maybe you should merge on master,
to be easy to test for not-git gurus :D
\[17:11\] \<oej> carstenbock: Using curl?
\[17:12\] \<miconda> carstenbock: in short, it was a discussion to make
a single http client module, as there are few other modules implementing
one internally
\[17:12\] \<carstenbock> miconda: Will do that.
\[17:12\] \<carstenbock> oej: Yes.
\[17:12\] \<oej> carstenbock: Which module is that?
\[17:13\] \<carstenbock> oej: utils
\[17:13\] \<miconda> ZogG_laptop: for clarification - the external
application is named mediaproxy-ng, but the corresponding module in
kamailio is named rtprpoxy-ng
\[17:14\] \<ZogG_laptop> miconda: yeah, thanks, got it from conversation
above and some google
\[17:14\] \<ZogG_laptop> :)
\[17:14\] \<oej> Ok, so we should propably build an improved http get in
utils, as well as something similar to json that suspends transaction
and returns in another route
\[17:15\] \<ZogG_laptop> i think http get/post would be enuf and what
would be needed are modules to parse responses (json/xml/whateverelse)
\[17:17\] \<miconda> ok, done with tech stuff?

## OpenSSL licence exception

\[17:17\] \<linuxmaniac> openSSL exception licence
\[17:17\] \<linuxmaniac> license
\[17:18\] \<linuxmaniac> oej: no mail from you on the mail list :-P
\[17:18\] \<miconda> linuxmaniac: ok, that was the next in list
\[17:18\] \<oej> I did brainstorm about it earlier this week
\[17:18\] \<oej> :-)
\[17:18\] \<miconda> but I thought of it more admin stuff
\[17:19\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: I can wait :)
\[17:19\] \<miconda> no, it is on now
\[17:19\] \<miconda> let's discuss it
\[17:19\] \<miconda> one way is to implement tls module with gnutls
\[17:20\] \<linuxmaniac> I think is "just" a matter add the exception
clause
\[17:20\] \<oej> carstenbock: How do I set content-type in the post
data?
\[17:20\] \<miconda> the other one is getting devels to agree with the
exception
\[17:20\] \<miconda> which most of them will do, but many are gone
\[17:20\] \<miconda> from the early stage of ser
\[17:20\] \<ZogG_laptop> oh, about that. i got kaamilio 4.x crashed with
tls when having reregister or two calls at the same time :(
\[17:20\] \* ZogG_laptop was talking about tls
\[17:21\] \<miconda> also, lot of copyright is by fokus, which was sold
to tekelec which was recently bought by oracle
\[17:21\] \<oej> Oh yeah, let's consult Oracle lawyers
\[17:21\] \<linuxmaniac> haha
\[17:21\] \<miconda> so we may need to buy a beer to Larry
\[17:21\] \<oej> So the problem here is that the tls module is not part
of linux distros because of this, right?
\[17:21\] \<henningw> hehe
\[17:21\] \<miconda> ZogG_laptop: do you have a backtrace?
\[17:21\] \<pdunkley> OpenSSL is used by other modules (for access to
the randomness and crypto routines).
\[17:22\] \<linuxmaniac> oej: I can't add tls on Debian because of
that
\[17:22\] \<pdunkley> websocket, outbound, auth_ephemeral all link to it
- BTW I am fine with the exception.
\[17:22\] \<oej> Yes, there's a few modules that Debian won't accept
\[17:22\] \<miconda> linuxmaniac: the question is, all devs have to
agree?
\[17:22\] \<oej> so we can clear those three modules
\[17:22\] \<ZogG_laptop> miconda: no here for sure. but i think i can
emulate it anytime
\[17:22\] \<miconda> linuxmaniac: or only devs to the modules that link
to openssl?
\[17:23\] \<miconda> because the core doesn't link to openssl, only few
modules (tls among them)
\[17:23\] \<ZogG_laptop> afaik i just read of some sip lib that switched
for smaller lib for tls/ssl instead of openssl
\[17:23\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: don't know, but I will say just the
ones that use openssl
\[17:23\] \<miconda> ZogG_laptop: a backtrace would be good and
eventually the log with debug=3
\[17:23\] \<oej> What is the background of the TLS module, was code
moved from the core to that?
\[17:24\] \<ZogG_laptop> miconda: would try to get one to you thru
maillist or tracker next week
\[17:24\] \<miconda> linuxmaniac: that would be easier
\[17:24\] \<pdunkley> Other modules are tls, osp, stun, auth_identity
\[17:24\] \<miconda> Andrei reimplemented tls module
\[17:24\] \<miconda> nothing from old openser core was used for it
\[17:24\] \<miconda> I guess pdunkley has nothing against to agree for
websocket module
\[17:25\] \<pdunkley> Some of the stun stuff is mine, but most has been
moved from Kamailio core. For my part I am happy with an exception for
stun too (but the original author will need to confirm as well)
\[17:25\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: I can try to ask on debian-legal and
see what they say
\[17:25\] \<miconda> stun and auth_identity is from iptel.org guys
\[17:25\] \<miconda> linuxmaniac: please do it, so we know what we have
to do
\[17:25\] \<oej> pdunkley has three modules to disclaim, but that should
be fine
\[17:25\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: noted
\[17:25\] \<miconda> linuxmaniac: mention also that we package tls
module separately
\[17:26\] \<ZogG_laptop> linphone apprantly switched from openssl to
https:*polarssl.org/
\[17:26\] \<miconda> is not part of other package
\[17:26\] \<oej> can we get agreement fron Andrei?
\[17:26\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: I will send you the mail draft before
send it to them
\[17:27\] \<pdunkley> Just checked, I can remove the OpenSSL dependency
from stun with a trivial code change.
\[17:27\] \<linuxmaniac> but anyways we have to add the exception
\[17:27\] \<pdunkley> I am happy to disclaim my modules.
\[17:27\] \<miconda> oej: probably iptelorg
\[17:27\] \<pdunkley> That means websocket, stun, outbound, and
auth_ephemeral are fine.
\[17:27\] \<miconda> but at least we know the target, I will get in
touch if it all we need
\[17:27\] \<oej> miconda: back to larry
\[17:27\] \<pdunkley> Leaves just tls, osp, and auth_identity
\[17:28\] \<miconda> for osp I can approach the company that developed
it
\[17:28\] \<oej> Transnexus
\[17:28\] \<miconda> although they were not very active, I guess they
have nothing against
\[17:28\] \<miconda> oej: yes
\[17:28\] \<miconda> but not sure how many users that module has
\[17:28\] \<oej> Auth_identity was a school, that should possibly be
fine if we can track someone down
\[17:28\] \<miconda> afaik, only that company had a solution to work
with it
\[17:29\] \<oej> tls is a tough nut to crack and an important one
\[17:29\] \<miconda> yes, tls is the one that needs it most ...
\[17:30\] \<miconda> the other important one, websocket, is fine
\[17:30\] \<miconda> for stun, I guess we can reimplement it
\[17:30\] \<miconda> doesn't look that hard
\[17:30\] \<miconda> and is not big
\[17:30\] \<miconda> tls has lot of code, on the other hand
\[17:30\] \<oej> Yep.
\[17:31\] \<ZogG_laptop> ok i'm off. bye and goood luck to every one adn
thanks for help.
\[17:31\] \<miconda> but first let's see what linuxmaniac gets from
debian-legal and then I will see how to approach for tls + stun
\[17:31\] \<miconda> ZogG_laptop: thanks for joining!
\[17:31\] \<miconda> anything else about openssl exception?
\[17:31\] \<linuxmaniac> ok then
\[17:32\] \<ZogG_laptop> and before i go i would paste again  may be
polarssl can be replacement for openssl as it mentioned on their site
curl/openvpn and others are using it and afaik linphone switched ot it
lately
\[17:32\] \<ZogG_laptop> bye
\[17:32\] \<miconda> thanks, bye
===== github clone ===== \[17:32\] \<miconda> next admin stuff: github
\[17:32\] \<miconda> Andreas Granig secured kamailio name on github
\[17:33\] \<miconda> pdunkley and few others expressed the willingness
to maintain a clone of the repo there
\[17:33\] \<linuxmaniac> we have a mirror at sipwise
\[17:33\] \<pdunkley> Github would work best if that was the primary
repo.
\[17:34\] \<miconda> so, do we get enough work force to maintain a
clone
\[17:34\] \<pdunkley> Biggest advantage of Github is fork management
etc.
\[17:34\] \<miconda> pdunkley: from Andreas I understood is a matter of
some scripts to merge back and forth
\[17:34\] \<miconda> but in case of conflicts, someone has to care of
...
\[17:34\] \<pdunkley> Yes.
\[17:35\] \<pdunkley> I suppose that is true.
\[17:35\] \<linuxmaniac> pdunkley: but you can fork with no problem
afaik
\[17:35\] \<pdunkley> But it needs to be more than a simple clone,
because if someone forks on Github and makes a push request that is
accepted, then the repo on Github is updated.
\[17:35\] \<miconda> the current repo is tied to many scripts and hooks
around, so it will be quite some work not to keep it anyhow
\[17:35\] \<oej> why did we leave sourceforge?
\[17:36\] \<miconda> besides the fact that github started to have issues
(e.g., availability)
\[17:36\] \<linuxmaniac> pdunkley: the thing is that you have to do git
am on our repo not github
\[17:36\] \<miconda> oej: when we merged the code, we had svn on
sourceforge and ser was cvs on berlios
\[17:36\] \<miconda> we needed root privileges :-)
\[17:36\] \<miconda> to make things fit together
\[17:37\] \<henningw> sf.org had also some issues that time (they still
have). One reason to go for a dedicated git was to have the flexibility
to merge the repos
\[17:37\] \<oej> Right.
\[17:37\] \<miconda> pdunkley: will not be a read only clone
\[17:37\] \<oej> Will we end up in the same situation with github
\[17:37\] \<miconda> github can get updates directly there
\[17:37\] \<miconda> the scripts have to do sync both ways
\[17:38\] \<miconda> Andreas said is something they do as well for some
of their repos
\[17:38\] \<linuxmaniac> afaik github is just a mirror for us
\[17:38\] \<pdunkley> I guess the big question is whether enough people
think that Github provides advantages to the project.
\[17:38\] \<linuxmaniac> no changes from github onto our repo
\[17:39\] \<miconda> linuxmaniac: check sr-dev for Andreas' email on
this topic
\[17:39\] \<pdunkley> My thinking is that the Github forking is a
somewhat nicer model than having developers with lots of branches, and
allows non-developers to work under source control without it
automatically affecting the main project.
\[17:40\] \<miconda> pdunkley: agree that there could be good benefits.
on the other hand, not keeping current one as the main one will be tough
and lot of work
\[17:41\] \<miconda> so, at least have to keep/try both for a while just
to see if github is good
\[17:41\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: "Everytime you push something to the
internal repo, the github repo gets automatically synced and
overwritten"
\[17:41\] \<linuxmaniac> so no changes from github on our repo
\[17:42\] \<miconda> linuxmaniac: "people have the possibility to send
pull requests and everything"
\[17:43\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: yes
\[17:43\] \<linuxmaniac> but no merge is done
\[17:43\] \<miconda> so I assumed they are used ...
\[17:43\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: you have to use git am on the "master"
repo
\[17:43\] \<pdunkley> linuxmaniac, miconda: but does the internal repo
get sync'd and overwritten everytime the github repo is changed?
\[17:44\] \<linuxmaniac> pdunkley: no changes are done on github
\[17:44\] \<linuxmaniac> this is just "read-only"
\[17:44\] \<pdunkley> OK. That's my point.
\[17:44\] \<carstenbock> I am definitely no GIT expert, but the current
solution "works for me". Are there somewhere a list of what would be
exactly better if we switch (or create a mirror on) to github?
\[17:44\] \<pdunkley> If we don't make changes on Github, we can't use
Github push requests etc for merging.
\[17:44\] \<pdunkley> So there is no advantage to Github.
\[17:45\] \<pdunkley> carstenbock: there was a discussion on the mailing
list. But it boils down to better developer management, and merging plus
integrated tracker that relates issues to commits.
\[17:46\] \<linuxmaniac> pdunkley: just a nice web interface and the
pull-request are received as mails
\[17:46\] \<eloycoto> we can use <http://gitlab.org/> in our server
\[17:46\] \<miconda> pdunkley: maybe there are tutorials to do sync two
ways
\[17:47\] \<miconda> I thought Andreas said they do merge on both ways
\[17:47\] \<miconda> maybe was on some private conversation
\[17:48\] \<miconda> but the actual question here: if we can get it two
ways sync, who is on board to configure it initially and then supervise
it?
\[17:48\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: he is just in front of me. No changes
from github
\[17:48\] \<miconda> linuxmaniac: ok
\[17:48\] \<miconda> i misunderstood
\[17:48\] \<pdunkley> I am happy to help with some of this. Not sure
what time I have over the next couple of months as I am travelling a
lot.
\[17:49\] \<pdunkley> It's conference season :-(
\[17:49\] \<miconda> this comes also to another point related to
administration
===== technical administration group ===== \[17:50\] \<miconda> building
a tech admin group
\[17:50\] \<miconda> with volunteers
\[17:50\] \<miconda> to care of various aspects of the project
\[17:50\] \<miconda> including releases, sysadmin work on servers
\[17:50\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: I'm still single, I have some time
free. haha
\[17:50\] \<miconda> typically was me, Henning and Jan
\[17:50\] \<miconda> linuxmaniac: great
\[17:51\] \<miconda> you are more than welcome to join
\[17:51\] \<linuxmaniac> that will be great
\[17:51\] \<oej> I can help more with the web site.
\[17:51\] \<qxork> Would love to help out. LOD.com is also interested in
donating servers, etc.
\[17:52\] \<miconda> also, in this tech admin group, I want to be able
to take some decissions regarding what software to use when we need
something new, etc…
\[17:52\] \<oej> qxork: I am willing to receive donations! Haha.
\[17:52\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: sounds reasonable
\[17:53\] \<miconda> ok, so here we have linuxmaniac, oej, qxork and
pdunkley (as volunteered for github stuff)
\[17:53\] \<miconda> just as summary
\[17:53\] \<miconda> me and Henning will stay in as well
\[17:53\] \<miconda> anyone else interested to join is welcome (after
some security clearance :-D )
\[17:55\] \<miconda> ok then, will ask also on mailing list
\[17:55\] \<miconda> happy that we have a core group formed here
\[17:55\] \<oej> Darn, does that mean I'm out. The security clearance?
\[17:55\] \<oej> Yes, that's progress. Thanks for inviting us Miconda.
\[17:55\] \<miconda> web access only doesn't require the high level
:-)
\[17:55\] \<oej> Oh dear. Well, it's a start :-)
\[17:56\] \<oej> You can ask NSA about me… Obviously they know it all
now.
\[17:56\] \<miconda> :-)
\[17:56\] \<miconda> ok, next topic (not to get late here)
\[17:56\] \<carstenbock> oej: They have known for years!
===== Kamailio World 2014 ===== \[17:57\] \<miconda> Kamailio World 2014
-- I want to know if there are dates that should be avoided from mid
March to mid May next year
\[17:57\] \<miconda> apart of obvious dates for Easter (orthodox and
catholic)
\[17:58\] \<miconda> and other public holidays in Germany (because all
will be closed)
\[17:58\] \<miconda> anyone aware of conferences, events that we should
not overlap?
\[17:58\] \<oej> Possibly April Fool's day because no one will believe
what you say
\[17:58\] \<oej> I only see IETF, but that's March 3-7
\[17:58\] \<miconda> the plan is to have it again in Berlin, being easy
with administration
\[17:59\] \<miconda> and good/cheap to reach from EU
\[17:59\] \<carstenbock> miconda: That's great! I'm in! :-)
\[17:59\] \<oej> Berlin Works fine.
\[17:59\] \<miconda> oej: April 1 looks as good candidate, thoug :-)
\[18:00\] \<miconda> anyway, keep in mind and ping me if you discover
something
\[18:00\] \<linuxmaniac> let's see if I can attend :/
\[18:00\] \<oej> Well, then we can easily release Kamailio 5.0 for
Windows supporting Lync
\[18:00\] \<oej> ..and skype… and… WhatsApp
\[18:00\] \<miconda> I'll make some proposals soon, once I see
availability of locations
\[18:00\] \<pdunkley> If you're going to do a Lync release it should be
"Kamailio One" like the latest Xbox...
\[18:00\] \<linuxmaniac> :)
\[18:01\] \<oej> Scchhh. The marketing dept wanted that to be a
secret.
===== Other world wide events ===== \[18:01\] \<miconda> other world
wide events?
\[18:01\] \<miconda> pdunkley seems already busy
\[18:01\] \<miconda> I will go to Astricon and most probably Fosdem, in
the near future
\[18:02\] \<miconda> although fosdem is next year
\[18:02\] \<oej> I will be at ElastixWorld and Voip2day
\[18:02\] \<oej> voip2day is in November
\[18:02\] \<qxork> Olympics
\[18:02\] \<pdunkley> I'm currently planning AstriCon, WebRTC Expo
(November), DevCon5 (December), and FOSDEM.
\[18:02\] \<miconda> so, if anyone goes to events, add news on the
website
\[18:02\] \<miconda> or ask us if you don't have write access
\[18:02\] \<pdunkley> Also Telecoms API conference in London in
November.
\[18:02\] \<oej> Where's WebRTC expo?
\[18:03\] \<pdunkley> oej: Santa Clara. DevCon5 is in LA.
\[18:03\] \<oej> We need URLs folks, send us the URLs
\[18:03\] \<qxork> I will be at Astricon this year from 2013-10-07 to
2013-10-10
\[18:03\] \<pdunkley> Might be some events at Google Campus London
coming up too.
\[18:03\] \<oej> We should have a pre-FOSDEM meeting. ANy dates set for
Fosdem?
\[18:03\] \<pdunkley> oej: FOSDEM 14 website is up
\[18:03\] \<miconda> oej: the rule was first weekend in Feb
\[18:04\] \<miconda> I guess they didn't change
\[18:04\] \<pdunkley> Telecom APIs: http:*iir-telecoms.com/
\[18:05\] \<pdunkley> WebRTC Conference:
http:*<www.webrtcworld.com/conference/west/>
\[18:05\] \<pdunkley> DevCon5:
http:*<www.html5report.com/conference/california/>
\[18:05\] \<linuxmaniac> oej: 1&2 of Feb
\[18:05\] \<pdunkley> Someone from Crocodile will be at the Upperside
WebRTC conference in Paris in December too.
http:*<www.uppersideconferences.com/webrtc2013/webrtc2013intro.html>
\[18:06\] \<pdunkley> oej: URLs a plenty
\[18:06\] \<oej> THank you!
\[18:06\] \<miconda> ok, looks like we don't miss many events out there
:-)
\[18:07\] \<miconda> so last on agenda
\[18:07\] \<miconda> next major release
\[18:07\] \<pdunkley> Actually we miss loads :-)
\[18:07\] \<pdunkley> Too many events.
\[18:07\] \<miconda> pdunkley: I know
\[18:07\] \<pdunkley> Anyone here going to TADS in Thailand (at the same
time as the November WebRTC conference)?
\[18:07\] \<miconda> even in Berlin are like 2-3 per week that look
interesting
\[18:07\] \<carstenbock> Exactly: For example FOKUS FUSECO Conference in
November (<http://www.fuseco-forum.org>), i will be there.
\[18:08\] \<miconda> pdunkley: don't think so, I got an invite, but I
can't make it, planning for some trainings instead
\[18:08\] \<pdunkley> Must be someone who can find the budget for
Thailand ;-)
\[18:08\] \<oej> I need to work… Three weeks on the road in October will
be expensive.
\[18:09\] \<miconda> :-) maybe you get donations
===== 4.1 release planning ===== \[18:09\] \<miconda> back to 4.1
\[18:09\] \<oej> Is that the skype/lync release?
\[18:10\] \<miconda> do you think we can freeze by end of september?
\[18:10\] \<carstenbock> oej: No that would be Kamailio One.
\[18:10\] \<miconda> any big dev plans still for it?
\[18:10\] \<carstenbock> I hope, i get the documentation ready for
IMS-Charging (Diameter-Ro).
\[18:10\] \<pdunkley> I have some additions I want to make to
auth_ephemeral over the next couple of weeks. But I am happy with
websocket, stun, and outbound now.
\[18:10\] \<oej> I have some new functionality in snmp to work with. I
hope to complete it soon.
\[18:10\] \<oej> Fighting with net-snmp...
\[18:11\] \<kethzer> Any help with Kamailio NAT configuration I am
unable to send file might be NATED issue
\[18:11\] \<kethzer> ?
\[18:11\] \<carstenbock> kethzer: We are still in the developers
meeting...
\[18:11\] \<oej> kethzer: Please send e-mail to sr-users and you will
get answers. We're in the middle of a meeting
\[18:12\] \<miconda> ok, i have one or two modules in mind, but they can
wait if I don't have the time
\[18:12\] \<pdunkley> I'd like to address some of the issues with MSRP,
but I won't have the time.
\[18:12\] \<miconda> so, let's plan freezing for end of the month
\[18:13\] \<carstenbock> Okay.
\[18:13\] \<miconda> if need it, we can prolong a bit
\[18:13\] \<miconda> otherwise, is going to be time also for the 4.2
===== TLS enchancements ===== \[18:13\] \<pdunkley> oej: have you had
any success with getting your TLS enhancements.
\[18:13\] \<miconda> we need new features for that version too
\[18:13\] \<oej> I have had no time for TLS. Just applied for funding
for working with it.
\[18:13\] \<oej> Personally I got lost in the code.
\[18:14\] \<pdunkley> You wanted to be able to set conditions on whether
to use a new connection when you call t_relay()?
\[18:14\] \<oej> Yes, after TLS connect I want to inspect certificates
and decide if we're going to send the message or close the connection
and fail.
\[18:14\] \<pdunkley> Something like if the connection didn't get
negotiated/validated the way you wanted you could choose not to use
it.
\[18:15\] \<pdunkley> Ah yes. That was what I suggested the xavp for. I
remember now.
\[18:15\] \<pdunkley> Need to find a friendly TLS module expert :-)
\[18:15\] \<oej> Yep.
\[18:15\] \<oej> At some point I would like to add DANE support
according to the draft I wrote.
\[18:16\] \<oej> We do have DNSsec.
\[18:16\] \<miconda> oej: hmm, you wrote the draft before the code?!?!
that's not good…
\[18:16\] \<pdunkley> oej: this security stuff will never take off. NSA
and GCHQ are listening anyway.
\[18:16\] \<oej> Yes, we should enable null ciphers by default.
\[18:17\] \<oej> I run Kamailio through some TLS tests but could not get
it to be approved. There's updates needed somewhere.
\[18:17\] \<miconda> any official topic to discuss?
\[18:17\] \<oej> I am happy to see interest in DMQ
\[18:17\] \<miconda> any other official topic to discuss?
\[18:18\] \<miconda> oej: yes, glad that cchance jumped in
\[18:18\] \<oej> IPv6 support in all modules
\[18:18\] \<miconda> we will grant git access
\[18:18\] \<oej> Should we try to set that as requirement for the next
release?
\[18:18\] \<miconda> oej: those I use have ipv6
\[18:18\] \<oej> Or 4.2 at least
\[18:18\] \<miconda> only the provider doesn't have
\[18:18\] \<oej> I noticed that json was hard coded to the IPv4 legacy
protocol
\[18:19\] \<oej> I haven't reviewed the others.
\[18:19\] \<pdunkley> oej: I remember people saying IPv6 was needed
right now back when I was at university. That was 15 years ago.
\[18:19\] \<pdunkley> IPv4 still working for me ;-)
\[18:19\] \<oej> 15 years ago I had ping6 working on Windows PCs!
\[18:20\] \<oej> We should at least have that as a requirement for new
modules
\[18:20\] \<pdunkley> All my Amazon servers are IPv4 only. Think it'll
take a miracle to get them onto IPv6.
\[18:20\] \<oej> Or just a tunnel from sixxs.net
\[18:20\] \<carstenbock> IPv6 is quite important.
\[18:21\] \<oej> I will set up a Hall of shame list on the wiki.
\[18:21\] \<carstenbock> It's a big topic with german ISPs.
\[18:21\] \<oej> Cool.
\[18:21\] \<carstenbock> Kamailio IMS is IPv6 ready... :-)
\[18:21\] \<pdunkley> oej: need to make sure you tell the Hall of Shame
entrants you've added them. Might help get them moving :-)
\[18:22\] \*\*\* QbY nennt sich jetzt QbY_AFK.
\[18:22\] \<oej> Oh yes, you will know the moment we nail you to that
wiki.
\[18:23\] \<voipjedijoe> Hey QbY how do i check by fault to see if it
happens before session progress
\[18:23\] \<oej> …he said with a dark voice
\[18:23\] \<oej> We're still working on Happy Eyeballs for UDP in the
SIP Forum IPv6 wg…
\[18:23\] \<carstenbock> Any other topics?
\[18:23\] \<oej> --none--
===== open discussion ===== \[18:24\] \<miconda> ok
\[18:24\] \<miconda> I will follow up with some emails in the next
days
\[18:24\] \<miconda> about releases, and major suggestions here,
etc...
\[18:24\] \<carstenbock> miconda: Thanks for the great work & organizing
everything around Kamailio!
\[18:25\] \<miconda> thanks everyone for participating!
\[18:25\] \<linuxmaniac> I've to leave, see you guys!
\[18:25\] \<miconda> linuxmaniac: married?!?
\[18:25\] \<miconda> carstenbock: welcome!
\[18:25\] \<oej> thank you everyone!
\[18:25\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: see you next month :-P
\[18:25\] \<miconda> :-) will be fun
\[18:26\] \<miconda> better beer than in Alicante last winter
\[18:26\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: sure
\[18:26\] \<oej> Going to Astricon?
\[18:26\] \<qxork> oej: yes
\[18:26\] \<miconda> btw, free discussion now, not anymore in
transcripts :-)
\[18:26\] \<linuxmaniac> miconda: some are on me
\[18:26\] \<oej> See you there!
\[18:26\] \<miconda> oej: yes
\[18:26\] \<oej> — This chat room is now open for normal
questions/answers/thoughts/recommendations and SIPpy things
\[18:26\] \<miconda> qxork: I think I have some emails to reply
\[18:26\] \<qxork> Yeni is staying home this year.
\[18:27\] \<miconda> just got my laptop back
\[18:27\] \<qxork> home as in, the bakery
\[18:27\] \<pdunkley> So there will be quite a Kamailio gathering at
AstriCon.
\[18:27\] \<qxork> miconda: I hate timemachine, btw
\[18:27\] \<pdunkley> oej: I see you're doing a keynote
\[18:27\] \<oej> Yep I am. Short one.
\[18:27\] \<miconda> qxork: proved to be the hdd cable
\[18:27\] \<miconda> so all data is intact
\[18:27\] \<voipjedijoe> hey everyone, I am having an issue with
dispatcher not failing over calls to the next destination when kamailio
gets back a 503
\[18:27\] \<voipjedijoe> any suggestions on how to fix that?
\[18:27\] \<oej> qxork: Say hello to Yeni!
\[18:28\] \<miconda> I had backups, but still would have killed lot of
time to restore
\[18:28\] \<qxork> oej: =)
\[18:28\] \<miconda> voipjedijoe: do you intercept 503 in failure
route?
\[18:28\] \<oej> Ok, dinner time. See you around folks!
\[18:28\] \<qxork> Talk with all of you soon!
\[18:28\] \<qxork> cheers.
\[18:29\] \<voipjedijoe> no at the moment I only intercept on 500s
\[18:29\] \<voipjedijoe> I need to intercept the 503 but only when it's
coming from my freeswitch and not sessioned by my vendor via
freeswitch
\[18:29\] \<voipjedijoe> it's an odd problem me thinks
\[18:29\] \<miconda> voipjedijoe: add also 503 in the condition to
re-route in falure_route
\[18:30\] \<miconda> iirc, 503 should be replaced by 500 when
forwarding
\[18:30\] \<miconda> so you should get 503 only from fs
\[18:30\] \<miconda> otherwise is hard to detect
\[18:30\] \<miconda> unless fs adds some custom reason phrase or special
header
\[18:31\] \<voipjedijoe> I agree, but what if my vendor sends me a 503
and I need to session that to my customer. If I add the 503 to my
reroute condition all 503s would get rerouted
\[18:31\] \<voipjedijoe> and since in fs I am getting this when I hit
max sessions or max cpu on freeswitch I don't think I can add a customer
header
\[18:33\] \<miconda> you can use different failure routes for sending to
freeswitch
\[18:33\] \<miconda> you send to customers and then to freeswitch?
\[18:33\] \<miconda> or what's the routing logic
\[18:34\] \<voipjedijoe> invite to kam-lb --> route via dispatcher to
fs
\[18:34\] \<miconda> kethzer: for the nat problem, you would need to
send some network traces
\[18:34\] \<miconda> so you better use mailing list
\[18:35\] \<voipjedijoe> I always get a 100 trying back from freeswitch
and then if I hit a limit I get a 503 Maximum Calls In Progress.
\[18:36\] \<miconda> so when you get other 503?
\[18:36\] \<QbY> voipjedijoe: so, have your invite come handled by
route_a, set a variable, the moment you see the 100 in the on_reply,
change that variable..
\[18:36\] \<QbY> if you see a 503, first check that variable, if that
variable says you haven't seen the 100 then send it to your next
destination
\[18:36\] \<voipjedijoe> I don't know how to do that
\[18:37\] \<voipjedijoe> ok but I get a 100 back from freeswitch all the
time
\[18:37\] \<QbY>
http:*kamailio.org/dokuwiki/doku.php/pseudovariables:3.1.x
\[18:37\] \<QbY> you shouldn't see a 100 if FS is rejecting the call
because of max sessions
\[18:37\] \<voipjedijoe> I am
\[18:38\] \<voipjedijoe> I currently have one of my fs servers set to a
max sessions of 2 at the moment, which will allow me 1 complete call.
Once I fill up that call I get a 503 back after I get a 100
\[18:38\] \<voipjedijoe> its xrazy
\[18:39\] \* QbY looks at something
\[18:39\] \<voipjedijoe> what do you mean?
\[18:40\] \<QbY> voipjedijoe: what do you have for
sip-options-respond-503-on-busy in sofia?
\[18:41\] \<QbY>
<http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Sofia.conf.xml#SIP_Related_options>
\[18:41\] \<voipjedijoe> I looked at this, but it seems to only be for
option requests
\[18:44\] \<voipjedijoe> so I just tested that, and I still get a 503
\[18:45\] \<QbY> after getting a 100?
\[18:47\] \<voipjedijoe> yep
\[18:49\] \<voipjedijoe> I could change it in the c
\[18:49\] \<voipjedijoe> but that doesn't seem like the best idea
