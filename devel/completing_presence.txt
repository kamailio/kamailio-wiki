  * GEOPRIV
  * External references in org.openmobilealliance.pres-rules documents (need to handle org.oma.pres-rules and pres-rules as different document types)
  * Polled presence (out-of-dialog SUBSCRIBE with Expires: 0)
  * Watcher filtering (XML in SUBSCRIBE body describing what parts of a presentity should be notified)
  * Anonymous fetch
  * Capabilities and user discovery
  * Partial notification

  * External references in resource-list documents
  * Polled presence (out-of-dialog SUBSCRIBE with Expires: 0)
  * Watcher filtering (XML in SUBSCRIBE body describing what parts of a presentity should be notified)
  * Anonymous fetch
  * Capabilities and user discovery
