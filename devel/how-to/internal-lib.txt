====== How To Create And Use An Internal Library ======

===== Create a library =====

  * make a new directory in ''lib'' folder
  * copy there the Makefile from ''lib/print/'' and change the name in it
  * add your ''.c'' and ''.h'' files.

===== Use a library from a module =====

  * add to the module's Makefile (replace ''print'' with your lib name):

<code>
SERLIBPATH=../../lib
# libraries, in the format path/shortname , where shortname is
# what will be used for -l
SER_LIBS=$(SERLIBPATH)/print/print
</code>

Compiling the module will re-compile the library automatically if needed (e.g. some change in it).

''make install'' will also re-link the module (needed to change the rpath).
