^ User ^ Message ^
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | hello everyone! we are going to start in 2-3 min|
| @63:matrix.kamailio.dev | 429 Too Many Requests |
| | No server is available to handle this request.|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | to allow a few more to join|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | ready to start ...|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | ok ... then first topic|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | major issues that need to be fixed|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | anyone aware of something not yet reported|
| @vseva:matrix.kamailio.dev | nope|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | in the tracker I saw some problems with latest ubuntu 16.04 with security updates for libssl|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | fearing that there can be some backport from libssl 1.1 back to 1.0, which is the default libssl version in 16.04|
| @vseva:matrix.kamailio.dev | no|
| @vseva:matrix.kamailio.dev | that was caused by me/us in the repo of kamailio-deb-jenkins|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | I think that's another one, I am speaking about https://github.com/kamailio/kamailio/issues/2274|
| @vseva:matrix.kamailio.dev | builds should be using latest lib version already|
| @vseva:matrix.kamailio.dev | ah, sorry|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | well, ubuntu 20.04 was just released..|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | maybe people should upgrade ;)|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | 16.04 is still with us through at least Apr 2021|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | don't wanted to suggest to not fix it|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | ok ... I will look into it, just wanted to see if any developers faced themselves the issue|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | I did not noticed anything in this regards, my oldest ubuntu is 18.04|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | ok ... then the next|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | actually the one from V�ctor Seva related to redis reply error|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | need to look at it as well|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | this looked also strange|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | because the example is using the same hiredis function like our code|
| @vseva:matrix.kamailio.dev | I will take a look this week to try to find out the cause|
| @vseva:matrix.kamailio.dev | for me not a big issue|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | ok, then next one that was added on tracker|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | about a sip client adding alias to contact parameter, conflicting with what we do for nat traversal|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | I haven't seen that so far|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | I will comment on the issue in the tracker, but if someone wants to add something here, let's discuss|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | first would be that set/add_contact alias should not be used for register|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | it looked to me more like a client/interop issue|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | not sure what we could do here better in K|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | that is usually for forwarded requests |
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | I guess the person does it in an edge proxy and then registrar saves it with alias param|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | normally it should be Path added and Contact unchanged|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | ok, anything else on issues?|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | if not, then next on minor releases|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | probably next on 5.3 is next week or the one after ... |
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | I plan to send an announcement after this meeting, based on what is concluded here in terms of major issues to be fixed|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | this one would be nice, but it is nothing to wait for a minor update: Debian package version don't support distribution upgrades|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev |  * this one would be nice, but it is nothing to wait for a minor update: Debian package version don't support distribution upgrades|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | is this one what V�ctor Seva worked on?|
| @vseva:matrix.kamailio.dev | I'm working on that|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | thanks :)|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | Henning Westerholt: do you have time for a 5.2.x in the near future? If not, I will plan it in my side soon after next 5.3|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | 5.2.7. would be also probably good to release|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | miconda: i can do it|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | @henning: ok|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev |  * @henning: ok|
| @vseva:matrix.kamailio.dev | I have a fix for nightly builds but not yet for upgrades|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | miconda: ok, I will plan it after 5.3 release|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | ok|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | then going to next topic|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | anything we need to do in our infrastructure ... new tools people would like to use?|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | thanks to Fred Posner we have now also this matrix server|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | I am still fan of mailing lists, but I am asked from time to time about web forums, etc ...|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | I like it much more than the old IRC 🙂|
| @oej:matrix.kamailio.dev | A big thank you to Fred Posner from all of us|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | Thank you =)|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | next topic ... kamailio 5.4 - the upcoming major release|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | anything major we miss and should be added (as a feature of kamailio)?|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | we have 3 new modules now|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | quite some work on a couple of other modules ...|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | just about to commit support for permissions to load the list of addresses from a text file|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | not for trusted, though|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | maybe in the future|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | and eventually some work on dialog to make it a bit more independent of tm callback|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | it is an overhead right now, imo|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | the module chain can get complex, indeed|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | tm still to be used for sending requests|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | especially if you have tm -> dialog -> uac etc..|
| @96:matrix.kamailio.dev | Improving dialog module this way seems very valuable (Julien  Chavanton)|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | anyone else planning any relevant new addition?|
| @federico:matrix.kamailio.dev | to dialog module?|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | one in my list for long time is still making use of cnxcc (for prepaid) a bit easier to use in config, by adding support to load its parameters from database|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | not to have to do queries in config|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | Julien: anything new planned for rtp_media_server module?|
| @federico:matrix.kamailio.dev | on dialog module I'm working to be able to set from script some dialog properties that are supposed not to change, like the routes-sets of the two legs|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | @96 - Julien -- see above|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | @federico -- ok|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | then, for a target date to release 5.4 ...|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | should we do it before mid of summer?|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | well, summer vacation will be a bit un-usual this year ;)|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | ;)|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | I think before fall is probably best|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | 5.3.0 was in middle of October |
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | so either mid of summer, or early after summer vacation|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | then I would set it for the mid of summer and delay if something pops up|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | fine with me|
| @vseva:matrix.kamailio.dev | mid of summer seems fine|
| @103:matrix.kamailio.dev | 👋|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | ok ...|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | next topic ... documentation|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | we discussed for quite some time dokuwiki vs markdown/github -- any new opinions?|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev |  * we discussed for quite some time dokuwiki vs markdown/github -- any new opinions?|
| @96:matrix.kamailio.dev | For rap media server module, my attempt to use dialog module was not very productive yet.|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | I don't think I even remember my old opinion|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | :-)|
| @vseva:matrix.kamailio.dev | I think I voted for markdown|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | I do like markdown|
| @96:matrix.kamailio.dev | Someone tested it recently hopefully I will have more feedback  but there is a lot of work to do|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | from my point of view was more about access to contribute|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | now one has to make an account on our dokuwiki, which doesn't seem to be very attractive|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | while having on github will make it open for pull requests|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | we will still host the docs file, probably built by mkdocs (or something else) to html|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | the big effort will be to translated from dokuwiki format to markdown format|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev |  * the big effort will be to translated from dokuwiki format to markdown format|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | This is of course some work, but could be probably scripted|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | I like the github idea|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | anything to make contributions easier|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | @96 Julien: ok, thanks. Planning to test it myself, but didn't get a chance yet|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | if we move to github, we should migrate the current wiki to it. to not have another docs source|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | at least the content that is for the current branches and is not outdated|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | if you search right now for some modules, you get old siprouter wiki, old kamailio wiki and current wiki ;)|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | this can be confusing, imho|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | searching on web was always confusing, returning old releases ... |
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | web has a very long memory|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | =)|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | :-)|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | in the end it will depends on some volunteers to do the migration, i guess|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | indeed :-)|
| @vseva:matrix.kamailio.dev | maybe a job for the online devel meetings??|
| @75:matrix.kamailio.dev | ok, we can try to do some 30-60min sessions|
| @vseva:matrix.kamailio.dev | It would be nice|
| @75:matrix.kamailio.dev | 1-2 per week or month :-)|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | 75 was me, as a guest|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | wrong window, left open when I tested guest access|
| @giavac:matrix.kamailio.dev | and meanwhile we could add a link to the latest versions at the top of older versions pages? I'd like to help with the migration BTW.|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | works for me|
| @vseva:matrix.kamailio.dev | giavac, that's a great idea|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | btw, I forgot to ask, related to dmq, any module that should add support for it?|
| @103:matrix.kamailio.dev | it would be great if presence active_watchers could use dmq much like dmq_usrloc|
| @103:matrix.kamailio.dev | i understand there is dmq support for presentity table but IMO that implementation was flaky when i tested|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | I never tested it as well, or saw it running in production yet (presence dmq)|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | to wrap up on docs wiki vs markdown -- let's try to come up with a plan on mailing list and take it further from there and see who can participate|
| @jsmith:matrix.org | I've done lots of document conversion -- so if nobody else volunteers, I may jump in and help|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | ok, so nothing else for dmq apart of seeing what is in presence and enhance for all records, if needed|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | Jared Smith: thanks, any hints you may have will be appreciated |
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | for the US folks: how is stir/shaken evolving there? I wrote the secsipid module, but not much feedback afterwards|
| @103:matrix.kamailio.dev | have not tested it but it's on the 2020 roadmap|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | I've not had anyone need to implement it yet... but people are very happy that it's done|
| @jsmith:matrix.org | miconda: It's been mandated by July 1st 2021 by the FCC, if I remember correctly.|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | I got only one reporting that it is working with their implementation|
| @jsmith:matrix.org | miconda: But the industry players still haven't figured out how they're going to play nicely together.|
| @oej:matrix.kamailio.dev | At some point we need to look at the new auth|
| @96:matrix.kamailio.dev | I asked West/intrade why they were not considering open source for Stir/shaken sharing the recent presentation from miconda|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | I know of people who have already added kamailio in anticipation since it's not in freeswitch or asterisk|
| @96:matrix.kamailio.dev | At least they are aware about this option|
| @96:matrix.kamailio.dev | Things are moving forward|
| @96:matrix.kamailio.dev | With proprietary tech|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | for me is not clear who is going to issue the certificates ... be the trust authority, if any is going to be assigned for such task|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | exactly|
| @oej:matrix.kamailio.dev | That's a PKI that's not going to work properly for sure.|
| @104:matrix.kamailio.dev | :)|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | and even when implemented, I expect it to be as useful as dkim was in preventing spam|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | :-)|
| @jsmith:matrix.org | It's being added to Asterisk, and we will be doing interop testing with @miconda's code|
| @jsmith:matrix.org |  * It's being added to Asterisk, and we will be doing interop testing with @miconda's code|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | @oej: do you mean new auth mechanisms? |
| @oej:matrix.kamailio.dev | yes|
| @oej:matrix.kamailio.dev | We've been working on this RFC for OpenID connect and Oauth2|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | what is pushed from IETF these days? I am on sipcore, but don't read much of it|
| @oej:matrix.kamailio.dev | And the replacement of MD5|
| @oej:matrix.kamailio.dev | I am trying to push a discussion on downgrade attacks, but people don't want to listen|
| @oej:matrix.kamailio.dev | The 3gpp people have their problem sorted out and not enough of the rest of us is there to push back|
| @oej:matrix.kamailio.dev | But for OpenID connect we need to handle encrypted JWT tokens and other cool stuff|
| @oej:matrix.kamailio.dev | RFC 3261 is getting an update to deprecate TLS 1.0 and 1.1|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | replacement on MD5 would be great, if only UAs support it|
| @oej:matrix.kamailio.dev | The big problem is migration path|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | but also worried about down-grade attacks|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | that's my question as well, when UAs will support the new auth|
| @96:matrix.kamailio.dev | I can ask questions to West we have FCC member|
| @96:matrix.kamailio.dev | I will let them know this is from the open source community |
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | well... from what we see with UAs... not until they absolutely have to|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | JWT can be added, more or less stir/shaken is JWT|
| @oej:matrix.kamailio.dev | Yes, the passport stuff|
| @96:matrix.kamailio.dev | In cas it does matter but I think they must be transparent in the end|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | and another generic question before going to next topic ... anyone seeing increase on using webrtc with sip (given the world wide situation)?|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | definitely|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | especially in call centers|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | yes|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | ok, good to hear!|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | next topic I had in list is about community announcement|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | this is practically about announcing related projects/services to our community, when those are not commercial |
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | so far we had a policy of allowing announcement about open positions (jobs)|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | and we also announced about siremis or other projects from time to time|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | but not sure if we have anything clear in this aspect|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | for commercial things there is business mailing list|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | there was also the phone announcement recently|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | phone annoucement? I forgot or missed that ...|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | saraphone?|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | ahh, right ...|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | so indeed, that is a perfect match|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | personally I am fine when a project is started/launched, but probably not for every new release |
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | I think is useful for community to know about such projects, but we have to set a limit not to get "flooded"|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | initial announcement/project started sounds good to me, more would be probably too much|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | also for major/established projects they have their own lists usually|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev |  * also for major/established projects they have their own lists usually|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | ok|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | any topic that someone wants to discuss?|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | looks like we are pretty good in the features list, nothing major that we do not have and want to add ...|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | I can give a quick update on the fuzzing project from me|
| @federico:matrix.kamailio.dev | I have an enhancement in my whishlist but probably for the 6.0 release|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | Henning Westerholt: sure|
| @federico:matrix.kamailio.dev | I'd like to overcome the limitation for which a tcp connection can only be handle by a single worker|
| @oej:matrix.kamailio.dev | Got to go, sorry. Nice chatting with you all :-)|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | ok, about the fuzzing: I restarted it with a new version of the fuzzer some month ago. I started two runs, one about server msg input, and one about cfg input|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | the cfg one is on hold right now, after it found some issues (had no time to dig into it much)|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | the main server one is running fine|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | Summary stats|
| | =============|
| | Fuzzers alive : 3|
| | Total run time : 206 days, 3 hours|
| | Total execs : 406 million|
| | Cumulative speed : 67 execs/sec|
| | Pending paths : 2484 faves, 44094 total|
| | Pending per fuzzer : 828 faves, 14698 total (on average)|
| | Crashes found : 0 locally unique|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | no crashes found 🙂|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | nice|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | the one for cfg is about syntax, need to sort grammar there|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | yes, it mainly tries to crash the cfg parser, which is rather easy comparing to the sip one|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | looked a bit, but then diverged to other projects, because it is a start up issue with unusual syntax|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | sure, it is nothing that normally is used in cfgs|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | federico: you are working on it, or just wanting to have it|
| @federico:matrix.kamailio.dev | starting to looking at it and giving some thoughts|
| @federico:matrix.kamailio.dev | nothing concrete, tough topic :)|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | right now probably you can dispatch it using send*() functions ...|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | we discussed at last kamailio devel meeting in dusseldorf that an architectural change might be needed for v6|
| @federico:matrix.kamailio.dev | yes :)|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | so maybe after kamailio 5.4 we should plan the v6 jump|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | anything else?|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | or should we conclude here ...|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | I think for the 6.0 topic we should have a developer meeting again|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | Nothing else from me... would love feedback on how this experience (matrix) was vs. IRC.|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | to better discuss and plan/architecture etc..|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com |  * Nothing else from me... would love feedback on how this experience (matrix) was vs. IRC.|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | if its possible again, of course|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | Fred Posner: I liked it|
| @federico:matrix.kamailio.dev | Fred Posner: I liked it too|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | Henning Westerholt: if traveling restrictions will be lifted :-)|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | sure we can plan for another face to face devel meeting and code most of 6.0 stuff :-))|
| @giavac:matrix.kamailio.dev | @fre|
| @giavac:matrix.kamailio.dev | Fred Posner: good experience, thanks again (apart the wrong Enter I just did :) )|
| @johann8384:matrix.org | 👍|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | giavac: you can edit the message|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | ok ... we can consider the devel meeting finished|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | we will have a summary on the wiki page (hopefully, or just this transcript)|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | happy to see we do not lack anything critical at this moment|
| @giavac:matrix.kamailio.dev | > <@miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev> giavac: you can edit the message|
| | no, I can't... or I need to understand how :) |
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | I'll volunteer for the transcript again|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | and happy to see people look for improved architecture for future versions/v6|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | giavac: depends on the client youre using|
| @giavac:matrix.kamailio.dev | > <@giavac:matrix.kamailio.dev> no, I can't... or I need to understand how :)|
| | The pencil, of course! :) |
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | 😁|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | now free discussion ...|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | if you know interesting news or funny stories from the industry :-)|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | Thanks to all!|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | Thank you all, as well!|
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | thank you! Missing everyone this week.|
| @giavac:matrix.kamailio.dev | Bye|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | everyone take care, stay safe and healthy!|
| @federico:matrix.kamailio.dev | I have to go (not too far...just the ground floor)|
| @federico:matrix.kamailio.dev | thanks and bye all |
| @lucianb:matrix.org | bye all!|
| @federico:matrix.kamailio.dev | stay safe!|
| @103:matrix.kamailio.dev | i tried to sign up for an official matrix account on here but it's not letting me login. anything special i need to do?|
| @henning:matrix.kamailio.dev | maybe just contact Fred Posner |
| @fred:matrix.lod.com | The homeserver isn't open for account creation; but the Matrix platform is federated... so for example, my Matrix account is on a homeserver we have at LOD. Others may have matrix accounts from matrix.org or their own deployments.|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | @103 - if you are a registered developer (have git commit access) and need a matrix account, we will try to find a solution, just let us know. Otherwise, this matrix server is intended to be only the host for chat rooms needed by Kamailio project, it is not intended to public user registrations|
| @miconda:matrix.kamailio.dev | besides matrix.org, there are other public matrix servers that allow user registration, I found this page collecting some of them: https://www.anchel.nl/matrix-publiclist/|
