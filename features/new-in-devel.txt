==== htable ====

  * added 'updateexpire' parameter to the definition of an htable
    * it permits one to change whether updating a value stored in the htable resets its time until expiration
    * its default value is 1, to preserve existing behaviour
    * however, if set to 0, updating a value will have no effect on how soon it will expire

==== xmpp ====

  * new parameter gwmap for sip-xmpp domain translation
    * gwmap can get a valus as a list of 'sipdomain1=xmppdomain1;...;sipdomainN=xmppdomainN'
    * whenever a sip-to-xmpp message is sent, any matching sipdomain in src or dst address is translated to appropiate xmppdomain
    * the other way around, when a xmpp-to-sip message is sent, then any matching xmpp domain in src or dst address is translated to appropriate sip domain
    * this allow getting rid of the URI encoding with delimiter
    * if a domain is not found, the src/dst domains are preserved as they are in SIP to XMPP and vice verse
    * if the xmppdomain is not provided explicitly, sipdomain is considered to be also the xmpp domain
