===== New in Core =====

  * IPv6 compile time flag removed - it is not possible to compile Kamailio without IPv6 anymore, improving the code maintainability in the core and several modules
  * set TOS for IPv6 sctp sockets
  * the syn_branch parameter has been removed from the core, as Kamailio was not fully standard compliant if this was activated.
  * auto-define cfg directive MOD_modname for each loaded module
    * example: if acc module is loaded, MOD_acc is defined in cfg
  * new parameters:
    * modinit_delay - specify microseconds to sleep after initializing a module in order to cope with systems having rate limits on new connections to db or other servers
  * removed syn_branch functionality for calculating Via branch parameter
  * allow c++ style of one line comments (i.e., / / comment ...) - can make easier the read of config files with defines and comments
  * execute event_route[core:receive-parse-error] block on error of initial sip message parsing - note that the SIP message is broken in this case, but it gets access to source and local socket addresses (ip, port, proto, af) as well as the whole message buffer and its size
  * store current executed cfg action in a global variable - can be retrieved by module to access name of config file and the line



==== Components ====

  * SCTP support implementation from core was moved as a module. No need to recompile everything to get SCTP support, just load sctp module 
  * STUN implementation from core was moved as a module

==== Makefile ====

  * added install-initd-centos target - install centos specific init.d scripts

==== kamailio.cfg ====

  * use "co" flags for engaging rtpproxy
  * route SUBSCRIBE for event message-summary to voicemail server

</code>

  * added commands to set extra columns in subscriber table
    * useful to deal with columns added for load_credentials of auth_db module
