====== Kamailio SIP Server - New features in version 3.2.0 ======

The page collects the summary (draft notes) of the new features in Kamailio (OpenSER) version 3.2.x.

**The release date for version 3.2.0: October 18, 2011**.

**NOTE: this page is not yet up-to-date with all new features in v3.2.0. Check back soon, it is updated right now, it should take just a bit. This message will be removed when the update is finished.**
===== Configuration File =====

The default configuration file shipped with Kamailio v3.2.0 has several enhancements comparing to v3.1.0. You can read more about all features provided by default configuration file in the comments located at the top of it. Shortly about the enhancements in 3.2.0:

  * refactored NAT traversal logic
    * use of rtpproxy_manage() to handle properly cases when 200ok and ACK have the SDP
    * enable RTP relaying in branch_route to optimize handling of parallel forking to natted and non-natted branches for the same call
  * speed dial support - enabled when adding **#!define WITH_SPEEDDIAL** after the first line
  * routing to voicemail in case of not available  - enabled when adding **#!define WITH_VOICEMAIL** after the first line and setting the voicemail server address in //voicemail.srv_ip// variable
  * blocking of redirect replies (3xx replies) - enabled when adding **#!define WITH_BLOCK3XX** after the first line
  * acc module shows how to store source IP for each accounted record
  * TCP connection lifetime is set over one hour to cope better with devices behind NAT connected over TCP or TLS
  * main request routing block name switched to **request_route** in order to be easy to refer to it. Note that **route** is still valid name for main request routing block.
  * load debugger module for WITH_DEBUG - set cfgtrace parameter to 1 in this case
===== New Modules =====

  * collector for asynchronous config functions
  * async_route(...) - execute a route block asynchronously after an interval of time
  * async_sleep(...) - asynchronous sleep for usage when processing SIP requests
  * README File: http://kamailio.org/docs/modules/3.2.x/modules/async.html

==== p_usrloc ====

  * partitioned user location service
  * similar to usrloc module, but provides partitioned user location. This provides 3 benefits:
    * Redundancy - if a location db is down, there is a spare running
    * Load Balancing - the module balances the entries by hashing the username(or username@domain)
    * Failover- in case of error and recovery, it ensures that no stale contacts are returned

  * README File: http://kamailio.org/docs/modules/3.2.x/modules/sipcapture.html

===== IMS Extensions =====

  * the IMS related modules resides in **carstenbock/ims** branch and **not included** in the release of version 3.2.x. However, they can be tested using 3.2.x, links to installation guidelines for IM extensions are available at:
    * http://www.kamailio.org/w/2011/01/ims-extensions-available-for-testing/

==== IMS: CDP / CDP-AVP ====

  * The CDP (C-Diameter-Peer) modules provide an Diameter-interface, which are used by several components of the OpenIMS-core: They are used as Cx-Interface for the I-/S-CSCF and for the Rx-Interface for the P-CSCF. The modules may be used in other ways, too (e.g. for an Sh-Interface for an Kamailio-based aplication server)

==== IMS: P-CSCF ====

  * The Proxy-CSCF in the IMS Architecture acts as an entry point to the network. The pcscf module of the original OpenIMS-core aggregates many functions required at this component: Header manipulation/verification, RTP-Relay and presence-support for the “reginfo”-event. Optional, the Rx-Interface for Billing may be enabled. 

==== IMS: I-CSCF ====

  * The Interrogating-CSCF is a kind of “Loadbalancer” or a entry Proxy for the “home-network” of an IMS setup. The I-CSCF will retrieve the location for a user from the HSS, it will check, where a user is registered or where it should register (based on user-settings, required capabilities later maybe even load). The icscf-module implements the according interfaces towards the HSS (Cx) and according header manipulation/verification methods.

==== IMS: S-CSCF ====

  * The Serving-CSCF is acting as a registrar and as decision engine regarding the routing of the Request. It retrieves the user-data and routing rules from the HSS and applies them to the processed requests. The scscf-module implements the according interfaces towards the HSS (Cx), the interfaces towards application-servers (Isc) and according header manipulation/verification methods.

==== IMS: MGCF ====

  * The MGCF-Module of the OpenIMS core implements header and content manipulation for interconnections towards Class 4 networks.

==== IMS: E-CSCF & LRF ====

  * The Emergency-CSCF and the Location Ressource Function (LRF) implements IMS compliant emergency call routing. The modules provide required content aggregation methods.



===== New in Old SIP Router modules =====

==== acc ====

  * you can include variables in table name and will be evaluated at runtime. For example:
<code c>
  modparam("acc", "db_table_acc", "acc_$time(year)_$time(mon)")
</code>

  * above example will write now to table **acc_2011_10**
  * same can be done for missed_calls table name
  * second parameter of acc_db_request() supports as well config variables
<code c>
acc_log_request("200 OK", "acc_$time(year)_$time(mon)");
</code>
  * by using **dialog module**, acc can generate user-customizable CDRs at once
  * added 'failed_filter' module parameter: a string of failure response codes from 300 to 999 separated by commas. Failed transaction will not be accounted if its response code is in the list even when failed_transaction_flag is set. For example:

<code c>
modparam("acc", "failed_filter", "401,407")
</code>

  * db_insert_mode can be set to 1 in order to use INSERT DELAYED when adding the acc records to database

      * example:
<code c>
  modparam("htable", "htable", "a=>size=8;dbtable=htable;dbmode=1;")
</code>
  * new attribute 'initval' to hash table definition
    * initval can set init integer value for hash table keys, meaning that if the key is not set, the init value is returned by $sht(htable=>key)
    * useful for hash tables holding counters - the value can default to 0, avoiding extra check for $null value
  * added two new PVs
    * $shtinc(htable=>key) - add atomically 1 to the value of the item
    * $shtdec(htable=>key) - decrement atomically 1 to the value of the item
    * both return the new value of the item
    * they work only with items having integer values

  * Added tag field to lcr_gw table whose value is assigned to possible tag_avp by next_gw() and from_gw() functions.
  * Increased lcr_gw tables version number to 2.
  * Script that upgrades lcr_gw table from version 3.1 is available as http://box.openxg.com/tmp/lcr_upgrade_from_3.1.sh.

  * updates to internal mechanism of registering as SIP user agents to remote SIP servers


==== usrloc ====
