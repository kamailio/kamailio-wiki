    * flags are: I (INVITE), A (ACK), B (BYE), C (CANCEL), R (REGISTER), P (PUBLISH), S (SUBSCRIBE), N (NOTIFY), O (OPTIONS)
    * KSR.is_method_in("IABC")
  * kemi - renamed KSR.drop() to KSR.set_drop()


==== Parameters ====

  * new parameters to control the size of pv cache
    * pv_cache_limit - the limit how many pv declarations in the cache after which an action is taken. Default value is 2048
    * pv_cache_action - specify what action to be done when the size of pv cache is exceeded. If 0, print an warning log message when the limit is exceeded. If 1, warning log messages is printed and the cache systems tries to drop a $sht(...) declaration. Default is 0
  * aliased global param ip_free_bind to ip_nonlocal_bind - match better with linux system control option
  * new parameter kemi.onsend_route_callback
    * allow setting the name of the function to be called by kemi framework as equivalent of onsend_route {}
    * default value: ksr_onsend_route

    * if set, kamailio creates a group of recursive locks used to sync on execution of request_route and reply_route based on hashing ID of Call-ID header. In other words, if a message has triggered the execution of request_route or reply_route, any other message with the same Call-ID     waits until the other one finishes the execution.
  * new parameter kemi.event_route_callback
    * set the name of kemi function to be executed for core event route equivalent
    * default value is not set (no callback function name). If set to "none", it is also not executed.
    * callback function receives a string parameter with the name of the event
    * execute kemi event callback for "core:worker-one-init"
