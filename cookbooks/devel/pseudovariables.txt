====== Pseudo-Variables ======

Version: Kamailio SIP Server v5.6.x (devel)

{{ :cookbooks:devel:pseudovariables.png?200|}}

===== Introduction =====

The term “pseudo-variable” is used for special tokens that can be given as parameters to different script functions and they will be replaced with a value before the execution of the function.

The beginning of a “pseudo-variable” is marked by the character “$”. If you want to have the character “$” just double it “$$”.

There is a set of predefined pseudo-variables, which have the name composed from one or more characters, and special pseudo-variables that are references to dynamic fields (AVP and Headers).

Pseudo-Variables are implemented by various modules, most of them are provided by **pv** (if there is no special reference to a module, expect that the pseudo-variable is provided by **pv** module).

===== Pseudo-variables usage =====


Pseudo-variables can be used with many modules, among them:

  * acc
  * avpops
  * htable
  * http_async_client
  * textops
  * uac
  * xlog 

===== The list of pseudo-variables =====


Predefined pseudo-variables are listed in alphabetical order.

==== $$ - Pseudo-variable marker ====

**$$** - represents the character '$'

==== $_s(format) - Evaluate dynamic format ====

**$_s(format)** - returns the string after evaluating all pseudo-variables in format

<code>
    $var(x) = "sip:" + $rU + "@" + $fd;

    # is equivalent of:

    $var(x) = $_s(sip:$rU@$fd);
</code>

==== $ai - URI inP-Asserted-Identity header ====

**$ai** - reference to URI in request's P-Asserted-Identity header (see RFC 3325)

==== $adu - Auth Digest URI ====

**$adu** - URI from Authorization or Proxy-Authorization header. This URI is used when calculating the HTTP Digest Response.

==== $aa - Auth algorithm ====

**$aa** - algorithm from Authorization or Proxy-Authorization header.

==== $ar - Auth realm ====

**$ar** - realm from Authorization or Proxy-Authorization header


==== $au - Auth username user ====

**$au** - user part of username from Authorization or Proxy-Authorization header


==== $ad - Auth username domain ====

**$ad** - domain part of username from Authorization or Proxy-Authorization header


==== $aU - Auth whole username ====

**$aU** - whole username from Authorization or Proxy-Authorization header

==== $Au - Acc username and realm/domain ====

**$Au** - username for accounting purposes. It's a selective pseudo variable (inherited from acc module). It returns the auth username and realm ($au@$ar) if exists or From URI ($fu) otherwise.

==== $AU - Acc username ====

**$AU** - username for accounting purposes. It's a selective pseudo variable (inherited from acc module). It returns the auth username ($au) if exists or From user ($fU) otherwise.
==== $branch(name) - Branch attributes ====

**$branch(name)** - reference to attribute 'name' of a branch

This pseudo variable gives you access to the "additional branches" only, not to the "main branch". E.g. if there are 3 clients registered for the same AoR, after lookup() you will have one contact in the "main branch" and two "additional branches". Using $branch() you can access the additional branches, the main branch can be accessed using $ru and $du. (Note: In branch_routes there is no distinction between the main and the additional branches - the branch_route will be called once for each one of them.)

The 'name' can be:

  * uri - return uri of the branch
  * dst_uri - return destination uri (next hop address)
  * path - return the path vector for the branch
  * q - return the q value of the branch
  * send_socket - return the socket to be used to send the branch
  * count - return the number of the branches
  * flags - return the branch flags value
  * ruid - return the ruid of the branch (Record internal Unique ID from usrloc)

The PV can take an index to access a specif branch: $(branch(name)[index])

Example:

<code c>
$var(i)=0;
while($var(i)<$branch(count))
{
   xlog("$(branch(uri)[$var(i)])\n");
   $var(i) = $var(i) + 1;
}
</code>

Starting with 3.1.0, you can assign value per attribute. Index can be used to update a specific branch:

<code c>
$(branch(attr)[index]) = value;
</code>

If index is missing, first branch is used. If index is -1 the last branch is used.

Assigning $null to uri attribute will drop the branch, for the rest of attributes will just set the value to null.

<code c>
$(branch(uri)[2]) = "sip:test@kamailio.org;transport=sctp";
</code>

**$env(NAME)** - value of the environment variable named NAME

Example:

<code c>
xdbg("PATH environment variable:  $env(PATH)\n");
</code>
===== $avp(id) - AVPs =====

**$avp(id)** - the value of the AVP identified by 'id'.

**$(avp(id)[N])** - represents the value of N-th AVP identified by 'id'.

The 'id' can be:

  * "[(s|i):]name" - name is the id of an AVP; 's' and 'i' specifies if the id is string or integer. If missing, it is considered to be string.
  * "name" - the name is an AVP alias, or if the alias is not found, it is a string name
  * pseudo variable - if value of pv is integer, id is integer, if string, id is string

$(avp(id)[0]) can be written in shorter form as $avp(id) and $avp(s:name) as $avp(name).

AVPs are special variables that are attached to SIP transactions. It is a list of pairs (name,value). Before the transaction is created, the AVP list is attached to SIP request. Note that the AVP list works like a stack, last added value is retrieved first, and there can be many values for same AVP name, an assignment to the same AVP name does not overwrite old value, it will add the new value in the list.

To delete the first AVP with name 'id' you have to assign to it '$null':
<code c>
$avp(id) = $null;
</code>

To delete all the AVP with name 'id' you have to assign $null to the index '*':
<code c>
$(avp(id)[*]) = $null;
</code>

To overwrite the value of the AVP with name 'id' you have to assign the new value to the index '*':
<code c>
$(avp(id)[*]) = newvalue;
</code>

The value of an AVP can be integer or string. To assign a value as string, it has to be enclosed in double quotes. To assign the value as integer, it has to be a valid number given without quotes.

Example of usage:

<code c>
$avp(x) = 1;  # assign of integer value
$avp(x) = 2;
$avp(y) = "abc"; # assign of string value
if($(avp(x)[1])==1) {
  ...
}
$(avp(x)[1]) = $null;
</code>

It is R/W variable (you can assign values to it directly in configuration file).

===== $expires(key) - Expires Values =====

Return the min and max of expires value for current SIP message. Contact headers are checked with higher priority, if no expires parameter there, then Expires header is used

If none is found, $null is returned.

Possible 'key' values:

  * $expires(min) - the minimum value for expires
  * $expires(max) - the maximum value for expires

When there is only one expires value, then min and max return the same.

Example of usage:

<code c>
if($expires(max)!=$null) {
    xlog("max expires value is: $expires(max)\n");
}
</code>

===== $xavp(id) - XAVPs =====

**xavp** - eXtended AVPs - are variables that can store multiple values, which can also be grouped in a structure-like fashion. Their value can be a string, an integer number or a list of named values (child values).

They work like a stack, similar to AVPs, and are attached to SIP transactions and automatically destroyed when the transaction is finished.

Each xavp has a string name and can contain a string, and integer or a list of named values. The structure name (or root list name) and the value name (or field name, or child value name) are separated by <nowiki>=></nowiki> like <nowiki>$xavp(root=>field)</nowiki> where "root" is the name of the structure and "field" is the name of the (child) value.

To assign a single value use:

<code c>
$xavp(root)="string value";
$xavp(root)=intnumber;
</code>

To assign a named value use:

<code c>
$xavp(root=>field)="string value";
$xavp(root=>field)=intnumber;
</code>

Like avps, xavp act like a stack. To refer to an existing value, use an index. The newest xavp has index zero [0].

<code c>
$xavp(root[0]=>field)=12;
</code>

If you assign a value without an index, a new xavp is allocated and the old one is pushed up the stack, becoming index [1]. Old index [1] becomes [2] etc.

<code c>
# new item (person => [(lastname = "Smith")])
$xavp(person=>lastname)="Smith";

# add new item (person => [(lastname = "Doe")])
$xavp(person=>lastname)="Doe";

# add another named value to the last example item
#   (person => [(firstname="John"), (lastname = "Doe")])
$xavp(person[0]=>firstname)="John";

# add another named value to first example item
#   (person => [(firstname="Alice"), (lastname = "Smith")])
xavp(person[1]=>firstname)="Alice";
</code>


Another example:
<code c>
# create new (the first) root xavp with a named value of string type
$xavp(sf=>uri)="sip:10.10.10.10";

# add named values (child values)
$xavp(sf[0]=>fr_timer)=10;
$xavp(sf[0]=>fr_inv_timer)=15;
$xavp(sf[0]=>headers)="X-CustomerID: 1234\r\n";

# create new (the second) root xavp with a named value of string type, moving previous one to sf[1]
$xavp(sf=>uri)="sip:10.10.10.11";
# add named values (child values)
$xavp(sf[0]=>fr_timer)=20;
$xavp(sf[0]=>fr_inv_timer)=35;

# create new (the third) xavp with a named value of string type, moving previous one to sf[1] and the other one to sf[2]
$xavp(sf=>uri)="sip:10.10.10.12";
# add named values (child values)
$xavp(sf[0]=>fr_timer)=10;
$xavp(sf[0]=>fr_inv_timer)=15;
$xavp(sf[0]=>headers)="X-CustomerID: pw45\r\n";
</code>

xavps are read and write variables.

===== $xavu(id) - XAVUs =====

Similar to XAVPs, but with single value items, therefore there are no indexes in the naming format. XAVUs are also stored in transaction context and destroyed when the transaction is terminated.

Examples:

<code c>
$xavu(x) = 123; # <- set the value
$xavu(x) = 234; # <- update to the value, not adding to a list like for xavps
$xavu(x) = $null; # <- delete the xavu
$xavu(a=>b) = "xyz"; # <- two level naming supported
</code>

===== $xavi(id) - XAVIs =====

Similar to XAVPs, but with key names are case insensitive. XAVIs are also stored in transaction context and destroyed when the transaction is terminated.


Examples:

<code c>
$xavi(WhatEver=>FoO) = 123; # <- set the value
# $xavi(whatever[0]=>foo) == 123
</code>
===== $hdr(name) - Headers =====


**$hdr(name)** - represents the body of first header identified by 'name'

**$(hdr(name)[N])** - represents the body of the N-th header identified by 'name'.

If [N] is omitted then the body of the first header is printed. The body of first header is returned when N=0, for the second N=1, a.s.o. In case of a comma-separated multi-body headers, it returns all the bodies, comma-separated. To print the last header of that type, use -1, or other negative values to count from the end. No white spaces are allowed inside the specifier (before }, before or after {, [, ] symbols). When N='*', all headers of that type are printed.

If name is *, then any header name is matched, e.g., $hdr(*) is body of first header, $(hdr(*)[-1]) is body of last header.

The module should identify compact header names. It is recommended to use dedicated specifiers for headers (e.g., $ua for user agent header), if they are available -- they are faster.

Example of usage:

<code c>
if($hdr(From)=~"kamailio\.org") {
...
}
</code>

<fc #0000ff>It is read-only variable. You can remove or add headers using functions from textops module.</fc>

===== $hdrc(name) - Number of Headers =====

**$hdrc(name)** - get the number of headers with the respective name

Example of usage:

<code c>
if($hdrc(Via) == 2) {
...
}
</code>

===== $var(name) - Private memory variables (zero) =====

**$var(name)** - refers to variables that can be used in configuration script, having integer or string value. This kind of variables are faster than AVPs, being referenced directly to memory location.

Example of usage:

<code c>
$var(a) = 2; #-- sets the value of variable 'a' to integer '2'
$var(a) = "2"; #-- sets the value of variable 'a' to string '2'
$var(a) = "sip:" + $au + "@" + $fd; #-- compose a value from authentication username and From URI domain
$var(a) = 3 + (7&(~2));

if( $var(a) & 4 ) {
  xlog("var a has third bit set\n");
}
</code>

**Note:** Setting a variable to $null is actually initializing the value to integer '0'. This type of script variables doesn't have $null value.

<code c>
$var(x) = $null;

if($var(x)==0) { # this is true
  ...
}
</code>
**Note:** A script variable persists over the Kamailio process in which it was initialized, so be sure of giving it a new value before reading it or you'll get the value asigned in any other previous message processed by the same Kamailio process (pid).

<fc #0000FF>It is R/W variable (you can assign values to it directly in configuration file)</fc>

**pv** module can be used to initialize the script variables.

===== $vz(name) - Private memory variables (zero) =====

Same as $var(name) -- added to pair with $vn(name).

===== $vn(name) - Private memory variables (null) =====

Similar to $var(name) and able to hold $null (which is the default value). The value is kept in private memory (pkg) and it is persistent across SIP message processing, within the space of each Kamailio process.

Example of usage:

<code c>
$vn(x) = 1;
$vn(x) = "abc";
$vn(x) = $null;

if($vn(x) == $null) { ... }
</code>
===== $shv(name) - Shared memory variables =====

**$shv(name)**  - it is a class of pseudo-variables stored in shared memory. The value of $shv(name) is visible across all Kamailio processes. Each “shv” has single value and it is initialised to integer 0. You can use “shvset” parameter of **pv module** to initialize the shared variable. The module exports a set of RPC functions to get/set the value of shared variables.

Example - shv(name) pseudo-variable usage:

<code>
...
modparam("pv", "shvset", "debug=i:1")
...
if ($shv(debug) == 1) {
	xlog("request: $rm from $fu to $ru\n");
}
...
</code>

<fc #0000ff>It is R/W variable (you can assign values to it directly in configuration file)</fc>

  * body: sets/modifies/removes the request body
  * method: sets the HTTP method: either "GET", "POST", "PUT" or "DELETE" (these are the supported methods). (Note: if the method is not set, curl will use GET, or POST if a body is specified)
  * timeout: sets the HTTP timeout. (Note, this timeout should be normally less than tm.fr_timer timeout, because transaction timeout has a higher priority over HTTP timeout)
  * tls_client_cert: sets the client certificate to use
  * tls_client_key: sets the client certificate key to use
  * tls_ca_path: sets the CA certificate path to use
  * authmethod: Sets the preferred authentication mode for HTTP/HTTPS requests. The value is a bitmap and multiple methods can be used.

  * password: sets the password to use for authenticated requests
  * suspend: if set to 0 it doesn't suspend the current transaction before performing the query
  * tcp_keepalive: enable TCP keepalive
  * tcp_ka_idle: set TCP keepalive idle time wait
  * tcp_ka_interval: set TCP keepalive interval

  * value[n] - returns value of the nth element. value - returns null for an array. You need to get each element by index.

In case one of the members of the array is also an array (for example calling SMEMBERS in a MULTI/EXEC transaction), the members of the array can be accessed by adding any of the above keys, after a value[n] key. The first value[n] references the element in the first array, while the next key references an element of the referenced array.

Example:

<code>
redis_cmd("srvN", "GET foo", "r");
xlog("===== result type: $redis(r=>type) * value: $redis(r=>value)\n");
