====== Upgrade Kamailio from v4.1.x to v4.2.0 ======

The page contains the details about the changes that were made to old components during the development of v4.2.0 compared with what existed in v4.1.x.

It does not include the brand new modules, focusing on how to upgrade database and configuration file from v4.1.x to run with Kamailio 4.2.x.

The draft with what is new in release 4.2.x is available at:

  * [[features:new-in-4.2.x|New Features in Release 4.2.x]]

===== Previous Stable Release =====

If you look for the guidelines to upgrade to previous stable release, see:

  * [[install:upgrade:4.0.x-to-4.1.0|Upgrade Kamailio v4.0.x to v4.1.0]]

===== Remarks =====

Following tokens are used to mark the changes:

  * INF - the change doesn't really have any direct impact to config content - no action required in old config
  * CPM - the change was used with the new value via explicit parameter in default config file from old releases
  * RCM - the change is recommended to be done if you had an explicit different or lower value for this parameter in old config

  * default value for hash_size is 10 (1024 slots) (INF)
  * parameter db_ops_ruid is set to 1 (RCM)

DELETE FROM version WHERE table_name='acc';
INSERT INTO version (`table_name`, `table_version`) values ('acc','5');

-- table: dialplan
ALTER TABLE dialplan CHANGE COLUMN repl_exp repl_exp varchar(64) NOT NULL; 
ALTER TABLE dialplan CHANGE COLUMN attrs attrs varchar(64) NOT NULL;
DELETE FROM version WHERE table_name='dialplan';
